legaladvice,2019 Taxes - IRS Free File program now open,"Hey folks, “tax season” is upon us, I wanted to quickly let people know that if your Adjusted Gross Income is less than $69,000 last year you are eligible to use free tax software as a part of a partnership between the IRS and a number of professional tax preparer companies.

Keep in mind that an AGI of $69,000 means that you could have made a decent amount more than that. Certain pretax deductions such as insurance, 401k, etc... it might be more. So don’t think that just because your salary is over $69k that the program isn’t worth looking into.

If you qualify you won’t just be getting the “free” lite version of the software that is advertised on TV, where if you have certain types of income or certain deductions you will have to pay more, you get the full versions of the software for free.

The specific criteria for each vendor varies, but if your AGI is under $69,000 you will qualify for one of them.

legaladvice,My sister is wanting my kid after I die,"I have always been straight forward and let everyone know that my son is to go to my best friend when I pass away if he is still underage. 

His dad and that side of the family are absolute trash— toxic, bigoted, racist, always the victim, entitled jerks. My side is mostly old and disabled except for my sister. She’s in college, has a good job, doing well. However, she’s kinda a terrible person. She’s also extremely introverted and gets drained easily. My son is 4 and special needs. I 100% do not think she’d be mentally and emotionally equipped to handle him. 

She’s saying when I die and Son is still underage she’s going to go against my dying wish, my wants, and my very thorough decision of what’s best for my son. She says she’s going to court for kinship if I die or whatever, maybe even now. 

What can I do to protect my son? He’d be best in my best friend’s and I’ve thought about it for years and it’s never changed. 

Thanks everyone for any help that can be provided.

EDIT: Wanted to add some additional context:

1 Dad is registered sex offender, against a minor female. My son does not fit the age or sex of his “preferred victim type.” He’s trying to be a better dad, so I’ve allowed more visitation based on that. The situation with his crime is... complicated. 

2 Dad is not financially sound to take care of Son. He doesn’t know how to budget or save. He’s currently in one of those rooming apartments and usually can’t pay his phone bill in a timely fashion, if that gives you any indication of his ability to take care of a child let alone himself.

3 Probably can’t marry friend because she in love and eventually wants to marry her partner. So no Chuck and Larry kinda thing going to happen there.

4 Friend is 100% on board about taking Son when I pass. Family... family is not because “faaaaamily should be with faaaaamily” even if they aren’t equipped to do so. Especially my Mother and Grandmother, think I’m not choosing my sister because I don’t love her or some BS like that and refuse to listen to my argument and reasonings. All of them are stubborn and feel insulted that I chose an outsider.

5 Sister thinks she’s stable enough to handle him. She’s fallen asleep watching him and he wasn’t there by her because he left to go to a different apartment. (My mother and grandmother live kitty corner across the hallway from each other in the same building. Sister was visiting). I just know, as he’s getting older and his, erm, needs are getting more pronounced and defined, she wouldn’t be able to handle his outbursts or special attention. 

6 I am dying, slowly, but most likely won’t make it through another decade. Also, in case of a fatal accident, I want him to be protected.

7 I am sure if it’s between Friend and Sister, Dad would 100% pick Friend. However he might want his family to take Son. Which, would be catastrophic. They are absolutely a terrible fit for taking care of him, given their track record with him.

EDIT 2: Decision. 

1 I am going to have Friend more involved with Son’s life, we live in a different city but I’m going to make sure she’s put forward with involvement. Also, not going to marry her. Unfortunately. It just doesn’t seem like the right step.

2 I’m going to see about estate and family lawyers in my area to:
A. To see about making sure Friend is Son’s guardian after I pass
B. Making sure Sister and Dad’s family don’t get him

Thank you everyone"
legaladvice,Code bootcamp preys on minorities and tricks them into indentured servitude,"TLDR: I got tricked into signing an income share agreement. Didn't receive anything that was promised. Now the school wants %12 of my income for three years and is threatening to sue me.

I'm wondering if this is legal and whether I have any recourse against this ""code school"". I'd appreciate any laws or examples that could point me the right way. I just want to know if I have a case or not.


Heres the story:

I was living in public housing in NYC when they sent me an email featuring this is non profit code boot camp that would teach us to code at no upfront cost. ( they actually never mention what the cost is when courting us )

It wasnt until after going through a days long interview process did we find out there was pay it forward agreement. Sort of like indentured servitude where if we get a job, they take a percentage of our money, usually called an ISA. I was reticent to sign, but there were two things: The pay it forward contract advertised helping future underserved minorities and poor people learn to code, and I was told I would have in depth training in computer science. I was told I would not find these computer science fundamentals on my own. I was also told I would have resources like a metro card to get there every day and a computer.

What I actually recieved after signing the contract was far from what I was promised. My class was made of 36 students, and taught by 3 different teachers ( one per day  usually). 2 of the ""teachers"" had graduated the program just the year before, and did not have a degree in computer science nor much industry experience, nor did they know anything about pedagogy and how to teach. The third teacher was a new grad with a computer science degree but he left halfway through. The PM who told me I would get training in computer science also left halfway through. Several other instructors and PMs in other classes left part ways through as well.

About 1/3 of the time at this program was actually spent ( haphazardly ) learning how to code. The rest of the time was spent on professional development training where we were taught to write resumes, interview, and speak tech lingo (while having no real grasp of the tech concepts). We were then paraded in front of tech companies as minority hires. But that doesnt actually work in tech. You kind of need to actually know how to code. So the only option was to teach myself how to code in my spare time. The resources they used were just links from Google anyway, I felt like I could do a better job.

The contract is written so that basically any job you get thats anywhere near a computer qualifies, which is almost any job. You just have to make more than 60K, and they will take %12 before taxes. And they spent a lot of time getting us to apply to jobs. Also the pay it forward part, which is described in the contract as helping future students learn to code, was actually a lie. None of the money goes to help anyone new, it all goes back to the programs investors. ( They're a non profit with investors that we have to pay back at 15x what its actually worth ) In 2019 they tried to get us to sign new contracts rebranding it to a bond. The bond removes the mention of helping future students and  is more clear about paying back investors. I never signed this though.

Also I received no computer and no metro card. I basically went into debt going to this program where I essentially taught myself to code whilst the administration enacted a comedy of errors.  My credit score dropped over a hundred points and by the end I was late several payments.

But my hard work actually did pay off and I was able to land an internship before the program ended. But many others were not able to and even if they got an internship, they were not able to keep up and get hired. I'm actually still teaching myself as theres just a vast amount I dont know. 

And now this boot camp is planning to sue me, along with others refusing to pay. They want 12% of my income ( before taxes ) for three years, which would likely cost more than an actual computer science degree almost anywhere. And I dont feel like I or any of the other students should have to pay.

This program specifically targeted young minorites and women. They tricked us into signing away our paychecks then taught us how to get jobs so they can extort it back from us. They are registered as a non profit and recieve grants and donations to fund their program. Yet they want us to pay tens of thousands for 8months of resume writing classes.

Is this legal? I mean we were so poor we'd sign just about anything to escape. And we trusted them because they were a non profit. Is there any way I can fight against this? I kind of want to get this company shut down, so they can't do this to more people."
legaladvice,"Victoria, Australia. Ex employer uses software I wrote while I worked there. I left more than two years ago and now they're demanding support and training for the software.","I worked at a business that among many other things does mailouts for small businesses in the region (things like membership renewals, statements, etc). In order to prepare the mailouts for the cheapest rates, we had to format addresses correctly with barcodes and group/sort the envelopes in batches that can be lodged with our local post office.

I wrote a set of scripts that I used to make life a load easier; the scripts batch the envelope barcoding, sort into the same order as the inserts that had to match the envelopes, printed guide sheets that went with print batches that our finishing team could understand, and printed extra information on the envelopes that could be scanned with some other machines to allow variable size lodgments day by day as jobs progressed. It essentially took what would be six hours work for a 20,000 item mailout into about fifteen minutes work for me, saving a whole day's time before a new job could start being fed to post. It also allowed partial lodgments, instead of needing six days before the first items could be posted, they could start going out at the end of just one day.

I knew how to use my set of scripts but they have no documentation. I also trained my co worker and she's no coder but was very competent using the scripts. I quit over another higher-up staff member's behaviour to a family member of mine at the end of 2017, and my co-worker quit just before Christmas 2019.

Now the business is faced with about fifteen large mailouts to go out in early february and they have nobody who understands mailouts, nobody who knows how to use my software, and they are pretty much screwed. I also suspect they've probably not been updating the data my scripts use (the address to barcode database, which we obtain from an outside vendor and changes regularly).

I was contacted by phone by their head manager (just under the owner) who wanted to know where documentation for my software was. I said I didn't do any, and I don't know if co-worker made any after I left. Manager said they can't contact co-worker. As there's no documentation, Manager said I have to come in to fix that and train people, and I simply don't have the time nor do I want to go near the business again. Manager said as it's my software and I'm the single point of origin for it, then I'm the one who needs to come in, and it's a legal requirement since I wrote it under employment with them. I said I don't think it is, and Manager said they'd have to look at legal options to compel me. (this happened over about three phone calls). In the last call on Friday two days ago he threatened to sue and I would be hearing from $business's-law-firm

I signed nothing about the ownership of the scripts, and honestly don't care who uses them, but I don't want to be responsible for their upkeep. I'm a completely amateur coder who screwed around with applescript, perl and bash scripts and a little C to get something running. I had a *really* good idea of how the processes I had to work on for the mailouts worked, but my coding skills are mediocre and untidy at best. I think they'd be hell for anyone else to figure out what's happening and why I made the decisions I did, so I may be the only person who understands how my script system works underneath.

Is any of this legally my problem? I was NOT hired as a coder or programmer. I was a workstation monkey and designer before getting shuffled into a coordinator role for mailouts which was when I wrote the scripts."
legaladvice,[MA] I was just named as the defendant in a lawsuit... I was a toddler when the alleged incident happened.,"This morning I woke up to papers saying that I had been served and I had been named as a defendant in a lawsuit,

Some piece of property, apparently, was seized by a town in MA after non-payment of taxes in August of 2000. I was a toddler. I called my mother and she has no knowledge of this property; I was listed on the citation in name of my father, but to make this even weirder -- he died in 1997. I imagine he had little to do with this as well. My father's residence was in VT, I was raised in NY, currently live in CT. He lived in MA at one point, but decades in the past.

The document states, ""You have been named in the attached tax lien foreclosure Complaint filed by the Plaintiff. The complaint asks the Court to enter a judgement ending any right or interest you may have in the land listed on the next page of this citation, for failure to pay property taxes or charges. This is known as ""foreclosing the right of redemption.""

The lawsuit was filed by some builder in Maine. The actual case says ""City of \[X\] v. \[Builder's name\]""

What the fresh hell is going on? Four other people were named along with me (one including my aunt). I don't recognise the other names.

My father had interest in MA, but did not reside there. His interest was in the south of Boston, though (think Braintree), and this city is a bit a ways outside fo Boston and in the north of the state. To make this even more odd, when I put in the address of the alleged property, no address comes up. No street of that name in that city can be located. It also says the builder is the owner of the property on a different page -- so what gives? But also lists an owed amount as $150,000.

This is real, because the lawyer offices are real, and it came via certified mail.

Can any lawyer decipher this for me? I tried calling the courts, but its Saturday, so obviously I got no answer. I'm very confused. I am a broke college student who literally does not have enough money to pay rent, so this gives me a ton of anxiety.

Edit: possible pertinent information: there was a trust established after my father's death since I was a newborn. There was not a lot of money in it, because he was not a wealthy man. Any money that survived is no longer in a ""trust"" but is just ""my"" money under my name, with no trust documents attached, as far as I'm aware. I rolled it into a retirement account because that was easiest. I think some still exists in a 529, but I imagine you can't sue for that.

Edit: I did contact the deed office in the relevant county, listed on the document, because I cannot find either of the streets listed (no address, listed as ""intersection of x and y"") or the coordinates. Maybe they can shed some light on the information."
legaladvice,Bio mom found specific details of closed adoption,"NM/USA

I adopted my son about a year ago. He has a restraining order against his biological mother and has not been in contact with her for years. She has a history of stalking and harassing previous caregivers. 

She has recently started emailing my son's lawyer and my place of employment stating she intends to get him back. She includes  details in the email that are specific to the adoption (the exact date, my age, address etc). My assumption is that she was able to get her hands on sealed documents. 

I reported the emails to the police but they say she has not done anything illegal yet... So there is not much they can do. 

I am beyond frustrated that she has been able to get her hands on this information... One of the officers I spoke to said I may be able to try a civil case to see how she got the details... I doubt this would get any where though... Suggestions?"
legaladvice,Dad Threatened to call CPS on me.,"Hi, so I’m a 15 year old female who lives in Texas. To add a little context, I’ve been living with my grandma for a little under 2 years after my birth father threatened to kill me.
My grandma never tried to get legal guardianship of me because he threatened her if she brought it to court.
So this brings me to a few days ago when he messaged my grandma about a medical bill he received from when I went to a hospital. (I won’t get into the message because it’s too long) but the gist of it was that he wanted me back in his home by tomorrow, or he will call CPS and report me as a runaway. 
I’m scared to death of this man and I know if I go back to his home he’ll kill me. I’ve already talked to my school about this, but the counselor doesn’t think he’ll go through with the threat. I also talked to the officers on campus and they said that on Monday they’ll check their database to see if I’m reported as a runaway, and that they’ll fix it. But I’m just concerned that I’ll have to go to my birth fathers house.

P.S: I’m really sorry if the grammar is not correct or if I’m rambling, I’m very scared and anxious at the moment and I’m hoping I can get some advice over what I can do.

EDIT: Thank you to the people who are giving advice, but (for personal reasons) my family and I want to refrain from having CPS involved in my case (more than it already is)."

legaladvice,New house owners saying we owe them money,"We sold a house awhile ago and recently the new owner called us and said we owe them money for some repairs needed on the house. They say we intentionally did not disclose the damages and are therefore liable for the cost of the repairs. We were unaware of these damages because they were in a difficult to access part of the house (think crawlspace). They are threatening to take us to court to get the money (and force is to pay for all the fees and costs associated with that). Is it actually our responsibility to pay for these costs? Can they actually take us to court? If we do end up going to small claims court, do we need a lawyer? They seem very set on the fact that we owe them this money. Please help, cause I just had a baby (with multiple health issues) and don't really have lots of money to spare."
legaladvice,HOA messed up on a property lien because of an incorrect legal description,"I am executor of an estate and am currently less than a week away from closing on the sale of a property owned by the decedent. The HOA of said property had supposedly put a lien on the place, but the title company told me they couldn't find one when they ran a search. 

After doing a bit of digging I discovered they did file a lien... but they used the wrong legal description of the property. If the sale goes through without them realizing their mistake, are they SOL or would they be able to get the lien money through other means? (Note: enough time has passed that no creditors are able to place anymore claims against the estate). 

The lien placed was from unpaid HOA dues ($1200), and fines (around $7000 from a daily $25 charge over 10 months for trivial infractions regarding small repairs not made on the home.) 

Before I found out about their mistake, I had put in a request to have the fines portion of the lien waived, or reduced. The board unanimously declined it and didn't give much of an explanation why. 

I believe if they do end up getting the 7k from the bogus fines, it will 100% just line their pockets. No actual damages were done, except for maybe the home looking slightly less aesthetically pleasing to passersby...? 

There are a lot more issues and shady details surrounding this whole ordeal, but I would rather not disclose them publicly.  I'm mainly concerned about covering my bases regarding the potential fallout from their lien fudge up. 

TLDR; I'm executor of an estate and am selling a property that will close next week. HOA intended to put a lien on it, but used the wrong legal description so no lien showed up on the title. 

Hypothetically, if they realize their mistake before closing would they be able to correct it that quickly? And if not, what recourse, if any, will they have to recover the lien amount? (The time has passed for creditor claims against the estate so they can't go that route)."
legaladvice,Middle school teacher wife accused of inappropriate relationship with 15 year old,"I’m in dire need of help. Still in shock. I can’t say where we live on account of not being recognized.

Of course I am in shock and have no idea what the first steps are for me and my two children. Both under the age of 6. I love her. But I’m pretty sure I need to divorce.

legaladvice,Is it possible to edit a trademarked logo’s aspect ratio? Getting different answers online and don’t want to mess up.,"So when I originally uploaded my logo to file for trademark I uploaded my own aspect ratio to USPTO’s website and it kind of smushed the aspect ratio together because the website only accepts up to a certain size. I never bothered faking the time to adjust it because I wanted to file it ASAP and get it done considering it would take about 8 months to get. 

Now if I’d like to correct the aspect ratio of the logo so it doesn’t look as squished together since my real logo is more spaced out, but I don’t want to lose my status because I “altered” it in someway that would remove it from being trademarked 

Is it possible to revise and re-upload a better logo that’s the correct aspect ratio for USPTO? I’m not changing anything about it, just the ratio. I can’t find a clear response online. If so, how would I proceed? 

I’m not sure why the USPTO keeps changing the way the logo looks once I upload it to check out from their side. It looks fine on my end but then uploading it, it usually comes out squished together, etc."

legaladvice,"Brother is profound special needs, hospital has accused Mother of raping son while he was in their care. Please help.","My girlfriend's brother is 22 years old and is considered profound special needs. He has mitochondrial disease and a few other severe health issues and is completely reliant on his mother and caregivers to live.  He eats through a feeding tube, cannot speak, and has been completely bed ridden (except when lifted into his specialized wheelchair) his entire life.

Last week he came down with the flu and was taken to the hospital because any kind of sickness is extremely dangerous to him, especially the flu.  While he was sick he developed a yeast infection on his testicles and the nurses were doing an extremely poor job of taking care of him.  His mother, who is his primary caregiver, came to visit and noticed he was extremely uncomfortable.  He often gets his testicles stuck underneath him and is stuck sitting/laying on them for long periods of time.  She took it upon herself to adjust him and to apply medicine prescribed to him for when he gets these kinds of infections.  While she was applying the medicine, a nurse saw her and immediately accused her of fondling her son. The hospital is now pressing charges against his mother and Adult Protection Services are getting involved.

His mother is now limited to two 15 minute supervised visits with her son each day.  He is no longer ill with the flu and should have been released by now.  Him being in the hospital like this is extremely dangerous to his health, not to mention he is alone and absolutely terrified.  Any time his mom comes to visit he bursts into tears and just seems completely miserable to be without her. His mom has not received any type of court order or information as to what happens next.

We fear that he is soon to be moved to a state healthcare facility where the level of care is far from what his mother and private caregivers can provide and removed from custody of his mother.

There are dozens of family members, caregivers, friends, etc. that will attest that his mother would never sexually molest her son.  These accusations are disgusting and they are ripping a special needs child from his mother and tearing the family apart.  My question for LA is what the heck do we do?  What kind of lawyer and agency do we seek?  This entire situation is disgusting and is a reprehensible act by the hospital. Any advice is immensely appreciated as this situation is getting dire.  


Update: We have hired a lawyer who stated that this hospital has a history of overstepping family law so hopefully things pan out."
legaladvice,"Stolen eBook, how do I handle it?","I published a book back in September, and I've recently found that the ebook version was stolen and uploaded, in full, to a website.

legaladvice,Fired for voicing workplace safety concerns.,"Location is Texas. 

I worked in a small printing shop for the last 3 months. There were no fire extinguishers or escape plans. The machinery was extremely old (1970s and older) without any safety guards. One of the machines repeatedly caught FIRE during use when paper would get stuck inside. To fix it, we had to insert a metal prong inside the machine to remove the paper. There were multiple chemicals (ink, IPA, lubricants) left sitting open. There are multiple electrical outlets that are exposed that spark and occasionally trip the breaker. The list goes on.

I voiced some of these concerns to employer last Thursday. He fired me without providing any reason yesterday. I am assuming it was in connection to my complaint as he would not provide me any other reason.

Do I go to OSHA? Do I report him to the Better Business Bureau?"
legaladvice,Building Manager is trying to get me (a resident) to register for a small business license in a live/work unit.," I have lived in my apartment in San Francisco for just over 8 years. I love my apartment and have done everything I can to be a responsible tenant.  I always pay my rent on time, I keep communal spaces and equipment that I use clean, I report security incidents, take care of my apartment, the whole shebang. 

The building I live in is combination live/work, so there are some units with residents, some with businesses (more of the former I believe). The building is not rent controlled because it was built after the cut-off date per SF rental laws.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 9th, 2020, I was sent an email from our Building Management (who are historically difficult to communicate with) that informed me of the following: 

*""As you know, \[my building\] is a live/work building under city planning code. With the new year the city is now asking that* ***one tenant in each unit hold a business license*** *in compliance with the live/work code.*  
*{They then provide a link for registering and a link to* [this](https://businessportal.sfgov.org/start/register-your-business/city-registration) *site for more info}*  


*Please note that we will reimburse you for the $104 minimal filing fee when you provide proof of filing and payment.*  
*Additionally, we are offering a one-time $200 rental credit for the month of March when you send us a copy of a valid Business Registration Certificate for your unit no later than January 31, 2020.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

I was prepared to register, as the note made it sound obligatory, but upon further inspection and some cursory Google searching, I had some questions and concerns. 

1. I couldn't find anything about this ""new requirement"" as of 2020 on behalf of San Francisco. 
2. It seemed when I went through the forms that there would be tax implications on me as an individual, and
3. there didn't seem to be any information for use-cases of residents filing for a business license, which seemed odd, given that there are so many residents in live/work buildings in this city, and it would seem that the rules for those tenants would be slightly different than a business operating out of a live work building. 

When I wrote back with questions along the aforementioned lines and asked to see the new SF requirement and additional info, my landlord wrote back a brief email that simply stated it was listed in Section 6 of my lease that I had already signed.  A [shot](https://imgur.com/a/jDpI7OZ) of the section she is referring to.

She also sent the following: ""*Fill in the form use your name to apply for it. And put in Sole Proprietorship and Zero gross receipts since you don't have any business. Also for the license start date to use current date (date they are filing application). If back date to the lease date or anything older than 30 days, it may generate additional filing fees.""*

&amp;#x200B;

 Based on this section, it seems like the regulation applies to Live/Work units that operate a business out of the unit and have a certain portion of the space dedication to the work/business- neither of which apply to me or my unit. 

I responded to my landlord noting that I don't operate a business or work out of my apartment and asked for more information. I have not heard back. My questions at this point are: 

* Does this registration requirement actually apply to me as a resident in a live/work space even if I don't operate a business/work out of the apartment? 
* I can't find this new legislation anywhere! Is this actually a new requirement in San Francisco, or are they completely making this up? 
* If I \*do\* file for a business license, will there be long-term tax implications and fees for me as an individual? Will I now run a business?!

DO I HAVE TO DO THIS? Any help here would be much appreciated."
legaladvice,A teacher at my school opened her door behind me while I was backing into my parking spot,"Hey, so just as reference, I’m junior in high school and live in Delaware. Last Friday, I was backing into my parking spot like I normally do, and while I was about halfway into my spot, a teacher who was parked next to me opened her door. By the time I saw it in my backup camera, it was already too late and I tapped the door. It was only a little scuff so I wasn’t too bad, but I still want it fixed.

She said that she didn’t want to get insurance involved since it’s only a small thing, so I gave her my dads number to call to settle things. When she called my dad, it was actually my schools detective who was on the line, and he was saying that he might want to write up a report for the accident. The detective is saying that it is either my fault or shared fault, even though the only person who he has talked to is my teacher. 

As far as I know, there aren’t any cameras that could’ve caught the accident since I was parking in the back corner of the lot. I wasn’t going fast at all since I was parking, and there was nothing I could’ve done to avoid the accident since there was no way I could’ve known that she was about to open her door. 

I’m supposed to talk to her/the school detective on Monday about where to go from there. I can’t see how I would possibly be at fault. What should I do and where should I go from here? Are there any other similar cases to what has just happened to me that I can read up on? Any information would be extremely helpful, thank you!"
legaladvice,"Owner of a Bar Posted My Friends Names, D.O.B, and Addresses Online","A few buddies of mine went to a bar at my college.  They must have been overly drunk and reckless because the bar owner is now filing a restraining order against them.  The question I have results from the fact that the bar owner stated he will do this along with posting the footage to YouTube all in an online Google review.  In this review that anyone can see, he posted the full names, date of births and full home addresses of my friends that were there.  I'm not saying my friends weren't in the wrong (they obviously were) I just don't see how this is something a bar owner should post about in an online review if he's taking legal action.  I'm honestly just curious and any help is appreciated.  Thank you

legaladvice,"[FL] Should I sue the landlord written on the lease, or the trust that owns the property?","I rented a house in Florida on a written month to month arrangement. My former landlord is claiming my entire security deposit for failure to give notice prior to leaving. I did give the required notice via certified mail and 30 days in advance. It's been 30 days since I objected to the security deposit claim via certified mail with no contact from the landlord. I'm planning to file a small claims suit.

The notice addresses for the above are local to Florida. Unbeknownst to me until after our move, the landlord and his agent hire people to receive their mail and do not reside here. Property appraiser records indicate the house is owned by ""LANDLORD'S NAME TRUST"" with an address in Ontario. The lease lists ""LANDLORD'S NAME"" as well as the name of his agent and property manager who I primarily dealt with while living there. The property was transferred from the landlord to his trust with a ""QUITCLAIM DEED"" just prior to my occupancy.

I'm worried about my ability to recover anything from a foreign landlord if I prevail. One option would be placing a lien on the property. Should I sue the landlord, his trust, or both? Does it matter? What other options might I have for recovering funds?"
legaladvice,Testifying on my roommate's behalf in custody dispute,"I currently am the roommate of a 30 something woman in Oregon, who up until recently had half time custody of her 14 year old son. The son would be at our place for a week, then at his dad's for a week. I'm not super close with them, as I have a super busy schedule and am an introvert, so when I'm home I'm most often in my private room with the door shut.

A few months ago, a cop came to our house and talked to the mother and son as the son had apparently threatened to slit his wrists while at school. The mom informed me after and we pulled all of the knives/sharp things out of the house as a precaution. A couple days ago, my roommate told me that her ex had reported her to CPS for leaving sharp things around the house and passing out drunk with her boyfriend while the son is there. As of right now, apparently the roommate's only allowed supervised visits with the son. She asked me if I would be willing to testify on her behalf in a couple weeks, since I live in the same space and am somewhat aware of the general household environment.

After the initial suicide threat we pulled all of the knives/sharp things out of the house, including everything in the kitchen, plus my own personal sharp things from my room. During my 10 months living with them, I know the mom and boyfriend have had a few heavy drinking nights, but to my recollection it's only happened when the son is staying with his dad. 

I want to help her, but have never testified for anything before and am kind of nervous about it. Is there anything I should know or do before testifying? Do I need to consult with her lawyer beforehand or check in with my own attorney?"

legaladvice,"Landlord passed away last Thursday, now what?","So my landlord, who was also a good friend, passed away on January 16th,2020 from pancreatic cancer. His house and ours is about 50 feet away from each other and on the same piece of land. Here's where it gets frustrating. He apparently had no will and even though he mentioned numerous times that he was going to put the property into a trust so we wouldn't have to worry if anything happened to him, it seems like that probably didn't happen either. His next of kin is his sister that lives in Las Vegas (we are in Idaho). I've tried reaching out to her to see what all is going to happen next (she's also a lawyer) but calls and texts to her have gone unanswered. I know she's supposed to come up here at some point, but no idea when. 

We have been renting this place since June of 2015. We paid rent weekly (worked out better for us and the landlord). At this point, we have zero idea who we are supposed to be paying rent to. We were just walking over to his place each Friday and paying cash and visiting for a bit and that was that. My understanding is that without a will, this will go through probate which is lengthy. And they usually have someone in charge of that account that will collect rent while things are getting figured out. No one has gotten ahold of us at all. So I'm not really sure what to do from here. For the time being I have just put this week's rent into a separate savings account since I have no idea who to give this money to.

Any advice or tips on this would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
legaladvice,Pet parent lies and OP is bit in the face by their dog.,"Location is Michigan
Warning: this is a long one, trigger warning for bloody injuries.

I guess I should start with I am a 21yo girl and I had just started recently at my job. I'm not going to say the name of my employer, but I'm a pet groomer. 

So to start, we had this maybe 4yo pitbull come in with her pet parent(PP) and he seemed super excited and hard to control. My coworker, let's call her Kate, (not her name) starts going over our standard questions we ask every PP.

Kate:""Has your dog ever shown any signs of unprovoked aggression towards people or animals?"" 
PP: ""Well... He was barking aggressively at another dog in the dog park... And he gets really excited and comes at your face with his mouth open sometimes, so be careful of that! Don't let him near your face, I wouldn't want anything happening to anyone, muzzle him if you have to."" 

We figured she was squirrelly about it all because she has an ""aggressive breed"" and we may turn her away for that alone, when there may have been extenuating circumstances, that caused him to bark at the other dog. 

We accept the dog and after a nail trim, I take him back to where we bathe the dogs and floor tether him. So, I get to the face wash, kneel down, just as I had for every bath prior, and he lunged at me, biting my face. Before I knew it I was gushing blood from my lip. Once I had regained my senses and realized I was injured, time felt like it slowed down. I looked at the dog and tried to think of any signs of stress or aggression that I was trained to watch for and he showed absolutely no signs before he lunged or after. Even at this point he seemed like nothing happened. 

I ended up with somewhere around 30 stitches in my lip and nose. They had to call a plastic surgeon to reconstruct it. Naturally, I was out of work for a week (until all the stitches were out) and my wages were barely compensated through workman's comp. But Kate filled me in on what happened after I left.

i was told i broke absolutely 0 policies during the event and that once she had gone back in the back, the dog was now growling and showing many, if not every, sign of aggression. She had his PP come back and get him, then reports were immediately filed and they were banned from our store. 

I later found out that he wasn't ""barking aggressively"" at another dog, he was attacking another dog, the other dog's parent got tried to save their pooch, and their finger got bitten off. So I was the second bite of this dog's record, and they had LIED to us during check-in. 

I've talked to a lawyer and tried to set up a case, but all I know is the owner's name, and the dog's name. I legally cannot get any information off of our system and even if I could, I wouldn't know how to begin to find this specific dog. 

As of when I'm writing this, it's been almost 3 months and my lawyers supposedly still can't find him, and I really have no idea what's going on in my case right now, other than they're trying to sue their insurance (?) And they can't find him.

As for my injury, it's going to take almost a full year before I'm fully healed. Workman's comp covered the medical bills related to my injury and barely compensated my wages.

So to the legal section of Reddit... What should I do? What advice can you give me about the direction I should take with my lawyers? I don't mind doing research, but I don't even know where to begin on what kind of rights I have."
legaladvice,"I'm classified as vaccinated even if I'm not, and I want to make the vaccine","I'm 15M and living in Romania. I don't have the measles vaccine but officially I do have it done, that because of my mother who is a GP, she signed that she vaccinated me even if she didn't (reason at the end of the post). And the thing is I don't want her going to jail or anything like that.

So, my question is, how can I get that vaccine shot without getting her arrested, fined or anything like that? Is there any legal way ? Like going to another medic or anything like that ? (Also I don't really want her to know that I took it) What would be an illegal way to do it and if I would get caught what would happen to me?

THE REASON

Her sister in law (also a GP) told her that she had a kid to vaccinate with the measles shot, and after she vaccinated him, the next day the parents came with the kid (who was completely normal before that day) and he was autistic. I asked my aunt if she had any problems with vaccines and she told me the same story. So because of that she didn't vaccinate either me, nor my brother (7M) with the measles shot."

legaladvice,Got arrested for a 12-13 year old misdemeanor warrant I didn’t know about..do I have options or is this going to be a pain?,"I got into a non collision accident on my way home from work this morning, so I had an officer respond to file a report for insurance purposes.

Surprise surprise he told me he had to arrest me for a failure to appear warrant that was issued in 2009 for a misdemeanor ticket I had gotten in 2007 in another county.

I vaguely remember getting the ticket...I was in high school. I’m 30 now, with two small kids and no criminal convictions other than a DUI. (Funny thing, this warrant has never been brought up before when my background has been checked.)

I’m making the two hour drive on Monday to set a court date up per the paperwork I signed before I paid $1010 to bond out of jail..

legaladvice,[update] Court coming up for three felony charges. Caught them while I was on probation.,"[original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/es3zd6/court_coming_up_for_three_felony_charges_caught/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

So I went to court and basically it’s either gonna end up bad for me or really good.  I talked to my public defender and he said that my sentence will depend on whether or not I can get the current (2) undesignated felonies designated as misdemeanors.  I’m on probation for 2 class six felonies and he basically said that I would have to pay off the fines I’m required to pay and to complete 8 hours of drug classes.  The difference between if I get charged having prior felonies vs misdemeanors is 4.5 years vs 4 months.  So apparently I have to pay somewhere between $1300 to $2500 in fines (which I don’t have).  So I’m kinda stressed because this is a huge difference in severity and could seriously screw my life up if I can’t figure this out.  No one in my family has enough money to help me out, and I make less than 25k/ year at my current job.  

I don’t know how long I will have to come up with the money but my next court date is February 12th, so hopefully I can figure something out before then. 

Thanks for the advice guys.

legaladvice,Insurance denied impatient hospital stay because they deemed it “not medically necessary”.,"In NYC. I went to urgent care for a kidney infection, with pain and high fever. It was confirmed by urgent care with rapid urine culture, I was sent home with script for antibiotics and was told to go to ER the next day if I did not feel better.

I did not feel better in the morning. I called urgent care and was directed to ER. I spent the next 17 hours in ER, with the expectation of not being admitted. I received IV antibiotics, and had lots of tests done. My kidney infection was reconfirmed, but no more threatening condition was identified.

I was supposed to be released around 7PM, but due to shift change and miscommunication the decision to release me wasn’t completed until 2:30AM, when I was again running a high fever. My attending told me she wasn’t comfortable sending me home and admitted me. I was transferred upstairs, to try and get some sleep in a hallway, as there were no rooms available.

I was discharged the next day, late afternoon.

I was required to inform my insurance of any inpatient hospital admission. I technically knew this, but forgot it in the moment due to the illness, stress of the day, and the fever I was running when admittance was decided. My fault.

Insurance is denying coverage for the entire inpatient stay, since nothing worse than an infection was diagnosed. But I was following medical advice. I was told to stay, is that not enough for something to be considered “medically necessary?” Or is that why I’m supposed to inform them, so insurance can argue with doctors against admitting me if doc can’t prove it’s medically necessary?

I expect a giant bill in the mail. Like most people I don’t have the money for that. That’s why I pay enormous insurance premiums.

What should I do now? Am I totally screwed because I didn’t inform insurance I was being admitted?"

legaladvice,Therapist with a contract issue (Non-solicitation clause),"Hi all,

Denver, Colorado here.

TIA for any help you can provide. I was a contract therapist for a small practice and was seeing roughly 70 clients. My contract included a non-solicitation clause that states that I may not contact my former clients for two years. Where this becomes a problem is with my profession's Code of Ethics when it comes to patient transition. I could not come to an agreement with the practice owner when it came time for the renewal of my contract, so it was effectively terminated at that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had a number of my former patients reaching out to me, and I have been referring them back to the practice, which cannot handle them now, due to being understaffed. Aside from that, a number of them have seen me for over a year and do not wish to do business with that practice.

What are my options and/or what bases need to be covered if these clients still wish to see me?

Clause copypasta below:

13. **NON-SOLICITATION**: In the event either party terminates this Agreement with or without cause, and/or following the natural expiration of this Agreement or any agreed upon extensions or renewals thereof, Contractor (including all principals or employees of Contractor) shall not directly or indirectly contact or assist another in contacting any client, firm, or company who was a client of Company at any time during the course of this Agreement for a period of two years after the termination of this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, Contractor acknowledges that it will be able to earn a livelihood without violating these restrictions. If the covenants or any part of them contained in this paragraph are held to be unenforceable, the court making such determination shall have the power, duty, and obligation to modify the duration or scope to bring the covenant within the bounds permitted by law, and the covenant in its modified form shall then be enforceable. In the event Contractor contacts or solicits, or assists another in contacting or soliciting, any client, firm, or company with whom Contractor had contact, learned of, or provided Services during the term of this Agreement, Contractor agrees to pay Company liquidated damages in the amount of $500.00 or two times (2x) the revenue that Company earned from such client, firm, or company within the immediately preceding twelve (12) months, whichever is greater. The Parties agree that (i) the liquidated damages set forth above are not a penalty, (ii) the loss and damages Company will suffer in the event of Contractor’s solicitation of clients are difficult to ascertain, (iii) the parties desire and intend to liquidate these damages in advance, and (iv) the liquidated damages are reasonable and proportionate to Company’s presumable loss and damages."

legaladvice,"My parents got divorced recently, need advice","So some backstory:

In September of 2019, my mother(50F) quit her job in Alabama (where I’ve lived for all of my life) to get away from an abusive boss, and she decided to take a job offer in Denver. The original plan was, that my mom and I(13F)would move to Denver in January of 2020, and my dad(who is in the military and a 49M) would move there after being transferred to California. But the issue with that was, in order to save money, my mom wanted to put me in a charter school. The lottery system there made me have to move a lot faster than we planned. Specifically, in the 1st week of October. So we got settled in and we are on the way to school, when she asks me to type a text message to her new boss while she is driving. I see a text message to a contactless number that says, and I quote, “I really enjoy listening to you cum”. 

Before I continue, let me assure you that this is NOT my dad. In my mom’s phone, my dad has a contact. Also, this unknown number’s area code was 429, and my dad’s area code is 205.

Anyway, I was at a loss. The entire day at school, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So in the middle of the night, I unlocked her phone and went through it to see what in the name of Jesus Christ that was about. I was blown away. She was sexting this guy, and he was sending dick pics to her. I couldn’t believe it. My mom was cheating on my dad.

The next morning, after I got home from school, I immediately texted my dad and told him about this. She found out I told him about it, and things got really violent, and it eventually got to the point where she threw a pair of winter boots(this was Denver- it feels like it snows every other day) at me, and it hit me in my stomach, hard enough to leave a bruise. I told my dad about this as well. That she didn’t find out about. 

Around this time, it was October 31st, and in the school calendar, that’s a break. My dad was cleaning up the house to put it up for sale, so that’s why he stayed behind. He picked me and my mom up from the airport, and the next day, I visited my then old school(ever since the divorce I’ve started attending this school again), and when I was done, my dad picked me up and told me that he had filed for a divorce. I was honestly ok with it, because that meant that I didn’t have to go back to Denver(he got special permission from his lawyer to prevent me from having to go back). On November 18, there was the temporary hearing. My dad won primary custody, and my mom was forced to pay the school tuition.

However, the hearing also stated that on every holiday that’s on the school calendar, I have to spend half of it in Denver. This I was really scared about. My 1st visitation took place in Thanksgiving Break. I had to spend a total of 4 days there. On my second day there, I wanted to go out to the mall with some of my friends, and we were walking around with one of my friends dads when I get a call from my mom. She asks me are you having fun, etc. I answer yes, we are in the food court waiting for Isaiah(that’s was my friends name) dad to get out of the bathroom. For reasons I don’t know, she started to act ballistic, saying that I had been without an adult the entire time, and that I was in major trouble and she was gonna come pick me up. When she did, the 1st thing I smelled from her breath was alcohol. She started yelling at me to the point of verbal abuse, and I tried to lock myself in my room. She broke in with a butter knife, and dragged me from the floor by the arm and started making threats against me and my friends. So yeah, I’m still traumatized from that.

When I got back, my dad and I went to visit his lawyer. I asked if I was gonna be forced to go back for Christmas, and he said yes because there wasn’t much he could do. 

Before I continue, let me also add that I’ve been diagnosed with an array of mental disorders, including ADHD, bipolar disorder, and depression.

I started to have more lows than highs with my bipolar disorder, to the point of suicidal thoughts. It was a week before my next visitation- Christmas Break. I started to formulate a plan to get me hospitalized- drink a certain amount of antifreeze to get me hospitalized to avoid going to Denver. I think the only reason I didn’t actually do it is because my girlfriend(yes I’m lesbian) talked me out of it at the last minute. She convinced me to tell my dad, and I did. So he told my mom about the plan, and the next day, I was put in a psychiatric ward. It was hell. I was confined inside a little room with now windows or clocks, where I was denied the right to talk to anyone, even my dad. However, something good did come out of it, and I got the documentation I needed to be able to spend Christmas in Alabama.

But then my mom made a bullshit move on all of us. She wanted that trip to be made up, and it was gonna interfere with New Years- which wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t planned a date with my girlfriend. So I went, nothing bad happened but I was scared every day that she was gonna become drunk again and pull some crazy shit. But nothing bad happened in particular.

Let me also say that the agreement says I have to spend 3 day weekends there, so Presidents’ Day, MLK JR day, that kind of thing. I was given permission to skip MLK JR day because I had a huge presentation to prepare for.

So my next visitation is Presidents’ Day. This once again would not be a big deal if I wasn’t gonna go to the valentines dance with my girlfriend. It seems like she wants me to stop having free time that’s not school related with my girlfriend.

So here’s what I need to know:

1. What is the official age in Alabama where a child can choose which parent they want to be with?
2. Do you think there will be enough time to get in front of a judge before Presidents’ Day?
3. How long does it normally take for a divorce to be finalized?

I really don’t want to go to Denver, so I will appreciate all advice given. Thanks!"

They have beef, or something... the FNP is known for being unreasonable and frequently drunk and her marriage recently ended. She's mad (and likely drunk) and out for revenge it seems and has contacted me via Facebook to basically slander my dad's girlfriend for being ""mean and scary"" and, to summarize her words, she wants my dad to know \*\*\*things\*\*\* about his gf that would ostensibly drive them apart.

legaladvice,[TX] What happens if a major lawsuit is ignored?,"Texas.

I have a friend who has a spouse that has recently been served with a lawsuit, requesting ""mandatory relief of $200,000"" or no more than 1 million, to include damages, penalties, etc.

Essentially, the spouse worked for an employer a while back, and while he was there, he bought a bunch of computer equipment for personal use and friends, and started fraudulently selling products to other businesses under the company's name.  Apparently, he also posed as other employees and created fake invoices and pocketed the cash when they were paid.

He was fired last year when this was discovered.  My friend has since moved out and the spouse has moved in with a friend/""business partner.""  Process servers have been looking for him since August, because he now goes by a fake name and has no job/bills/etc.  (From what we can tell, he is still making big money doing *something.*)

We strongly suspect he is either not going to be found or will be found but will try to skip out.

legaladvice,staten island new york.," 

* I rent a house floor in Staten Island, its a new construction area, it's a community with an HOA but no parking signs out.
* There is road work being done nearby and the construction crew, from the city, is parking in my parking spot that I was promised by the Landlord. But he said can't do much because the HOA won't be passed over to them until March. Because its a new construction home. Some parts of the city see the street as public parking still.
* That's the background.
* One of the crew member park their car near the lawn, which is basically the street parking, I mention lawn because there is a automatic sprinkler system set up, and they have their window down. The dude came back earlier and his car is wet, many of his paperwork is wet. Who's at fault?

Also, this is happening a lot more often, having my parking spot stolen like that. I compile a list of things I want to do, but not sure if I can. If someone can help me that would be amazing.

1. Have other neighbors help me box the dudes car in so he can't get out. Should be Legal since we are the ones who have been given the right to live and park here. According to the landlord, they also own 10-15 feet of the street, so basically we can park on his land.
2. Put trash on his car? trash bags, clean ones, maybe some McDonald stuff. nothing gross.
3. Put out a no parking sign because its a private property and community, then get his car towed.
4. Bother his foreman on the site job to move his car cause I can't park my car and cause I have nothing else to do.

Something I forget to mention, he parked his car and is taking up 2 parking spots, mine and a different neighbor.

1. Go to his work area and honk my car like crazy, This area doesn't have a honking fine. And if a noise compliant would arise, my defense is the construction is causing more noise than me. I live close enough its only about 5 cars distance away, I hear it when I rest at home sometime.
2. Have my dog pee or poop near his car.
3. Purposely have the sprinkler on longer than regular, just thought of this.
4. Hmmm, Im out, anyone got any suggestions?

legaladvice,"A Californian vendor took $135K as a down payment for an equipment line (40% of the total), and he didn’t deliver. How do I sue him/his company?

The vendor is uncooperative, and we don’t know how to go about suing him. He’s made the equipment, but refuses to sell it under our terms. Our terms are simply to deliver after we’ve paid 90%, and we would pay 10% once the equipment is installed. We’ve had this problem from 13 months. We don’t have money to invest in lawyers who may not have the authority to solve this, how will this process work? Can I sue from Texas? Do I sue from California? If so, can I sue in California as a Texan? What kind of lawyer should I be looking for? Help.

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to include that. (I’ve never needed legal advice, and I tried to be concise) I took out an SBA loan, and my mistake was not signing any contract with the vendor.

After 12 months, we started “putting pressure” on him, but to no avail."

There is a tenant in the space below who loves to smoke cigarettes in their apartment. This, of course, seeps up into my apartment. It hasn't been as much an issue the past few years, largely because I would keep my windows open and some fans going.

I now have a 7 month old and, it being winter, this is much less viable an option. I've tried knocking on the door a few times and have left a note on the door asking them to, at the very least, open some windows when they smoke. No responses.

I figured the landlord might be able to help, seeing as the lease indicates smoking is not allowed. I was told that the resident below has lived there for nearly 20 years and they don't feel there is anything they can do.

What are my options? I know there is a rent withholding statute in MA, but I'm not sure this qualifies as an ""unlivable"" situation.

legaladvice,Can I Be Personal Sued For Defaulting On A Business Loan By the Guarantor?,"This is a really sticky situation to bear with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018 my fiance started a business with a friend and had to get a business loan to start it. Due to neither having a lot of assets they needed a guarantor for the loan.

The business partner's mother secured her house against the loan so they could start the business.

Fast forward 7 or 8 months and the mother suddenly dies, leaving the house and other assets to the business partner and her siblings. 

The business isn't doing too great and is about to shut, meaning the loan will default and I'm guessing the house will be sold by the loan company to recoup the money owed?

If this does occur, could the beneficiaries of the house personally sue my fiance for her share of the loan to recoup the inheritance lost?

The business is a Limited Company and the documents signed were;

A hire purchase agreement signed by the 2 business owners and the mother.

A Debenture signed by the business partner

A legal charge for the house signed by the mother.

Just me and her were on the lease, month to month. As soon as I said I wanted him to start paying, she took herself off the lease and vacated 30 days after. Left a very sour taste in my mouth. She's telling everybody she left on her own accord, which is fine, I know in my heart I finally stood up for myself and told her to leave with her deadbeat guy.
 
She then said I have to pay her back her half of the security deposit of about $800. If we ended things on good terms I wouldn't mind, but we didn't so I don't want to give her anything. 
 
I'd like to tell her something along these lines: ""Well if I take 800 divided by the 30 months your boyfriend lived here for free, that's $26 a month, which is obviously more than generous to charge him for staying there for 2.5 years."" Shit, I'd kill to live somewhere for $26 a month.
 
Could there be any legal repercussions to me if I denied giving her back that money? Could she sue me over it and win? Is this even a legal issue? Am I in the wrong for wanting to do this?

legaladvice,[CA] Mom bought property in my name when I was 18 and collects rent on it. Won't agree to transfer ownership to herself.,"Hello, first time posting. Sorry if this seems like a very basic or obvious problem (not sure if something like this is posted elsewhere).

My mom bought investment properties in my name when I was 18 against my wishes. They are not particularly lucrative, but she has been collecting rent on them for my entire adult life (over 10 years). I have never seen these houses in person (five hours from where I live), and I have also never met the tenants. I am also not the one who receives the rent checks. But I do include the houses in my tax returns.

She and I have a very bad relationship; I am mostly resentful over having this particular tie to her. I have asked her to transfer the ownership to her name many times over the past 10 years, but she flat out refuses, and usually ends up threatening me or using other manipulation tactics when I bring it up.

I would like to sever this financial tie between us as a way to cut contact with her once and for all. I don't care about the money. I just want her out of my life.

What is the best way for me to proceed in this situation? I'm thinking the most obvious thing to do would be to sell the properties and give her the cash from the sale. I'm sure she will put up a fight, so I am wondering what I need to do in order to protect myself legally. I am also really worried about the possibility of me having helped her commit tax fraud over the years.

Thanks in advance for your advice."

We rented a car through a company that lets people rent out their personal cars (pretty much airbnb for cars).  We dropped off the car and the cohost (hosts brother) said that everything looked good and drove away.  We didnt notice any damage with the car.  A month later we receivied an email from an independent adjustor contracted out by the rental company saying they were going to charge my wifes card 900 dollars for damage. We never received any notification before this.  My wife got a new card since the trip so we were not charged.  We looked on the app and every picture of the car to support the claim was taken an hour after we dropped it off and at the hosts apartment complex.  The pictures were of two small scuffs.  We tried to contact the host and the adjustor to dispute the claim, but neither got back to us.  They sent the bill to collections and we started receiving calls and emails from them.

legaladvice,(Az) Want to leave my husband but I don’t want to lose my daughter,"I’ve been wanting to leave for quite some time as my husband is violent towards me, but I haven’t done so because:
a) I have no evidence of his assault. He hasn’t left me bruises and even tho we have security cameras, they never record the exact moment (don’t buy Chinese).
b) I don’t have any money or a job since I’m a stay at home mom because we don’t have enough for daycare. My family of course offers financial support if needed, but they’re in Mexico.
c) since I don’t have evidence or a job, I’m afraid of trying to divorce him and losing my daughter’s custody to him. I’ve never seen him been violent towards her, but I’m afraid that if I’m gone, he’ll be.
d) I’m a legal resident but he and my daughter are US citizens 

My question is, is it possible for me to leave the country with my daughter and have my divorce process outside of the US?
I’m afraid of starting the process here, as he has threatened to kill me before and one time he tried to when I caught him sexting and told him I was leaving. Since then, I’ve been just quiet and afraid.

Also, he’s on probation with an undesignated felony. I think in the end the charge was dv or something like that. I cannot talk more about the original charge. With that on mind. would that help me to get custody of our daughter?"
legaladvice,Eviction Proceedings with Only 2 Business Days Notice,"Hi everyone. I live in Greensboro, North Carolina and reside in a complex owned by a company that owns hundreds of these complexes across the country. When myself and my son moved into our home back in August I was attending school and receiving monthly dispensations from my student loans. I found a job at the end of September, but during that month an individual driving a truck ran into my vehicle in a Walmart parking lot. The insurance adjusters couldn't determine fault so it fell on me to cover my deductible. 

Now to say that I was on a thin budget is spinning it in a positive light. This beginning for us was just that, a beginning. In October, I was going to be late with my rent and communicated that with the company. I told them how late and exactly when I would be able to settle. They refused to work with me on dates and were rigid with the date they filed paperwork with the courts; the 12th of every month. So in October I was hit with a 5% late fee which included rent, water, sewer, and trash as they were all considered one whole payment. I was also hit with a $250 court fee payable to them regardless of whether or not the case ever went to court. This took everything I made and received to cover and placed me late for the following month of November. This started a cycle that has compounded each following month. I'm essentially covering the previous month, plus late %, plus court costs although I haven't seen the inside of a courtroom once and no eviction has been levied against me.
This all leads up to this month. I admit that I am at fault out of my ignorance for the spot I'm in. 

This being the first time I've returned to school in 17 years I am a little uninformed. Last semester school started on the 6th of September and my first dispensation was released on the 17th, immediately followed by a second on the 24th. Having not been told otherwise I expected the same this semester. That was not the case. The 18th of January rolled around and I began to worry. I had informed the office that I would be receiving my funds, same as last time, on the 17th and I would have the remainder of my past due on the 18th and current due on the 25th. The school was closed so that offered no information. Monday was MLK and they were closed as well. I finally reached financial aid on Tuesday which informed me that this semester they would be holding financial aid until the following 17th; an additional four weeks. Needless to say I lost my shit quickly and loudly. I wasn't informed of this change either at orientation or discussion with my financial aid officer at any time during the previous semester or following break.

I was served yesterday with a court summons for this coming Tuesday the 28th. This company is notorious for being inflexible and after talking to neighbors and previous tenants I come to expect no bending. I've asked the financial aid office to provide me with promissory notes for my February payments to possibly help reach some kind of resolution, but they said they can't provide those. I plan on printing a document showing the dates of payment along with a spreadsheet showing the actual dispensation amounts. I also intend to bring proof of the recurring $250 court fees. I also have been promoted to full-time with the company I'm working as of last week which eliminates working two part-time jobs.

1. Is there anything else I can bring to help the court reach some kind of reconciliation? Should I expect the court to help at all?
2. If the probable happens and I'm ordered to vacate what kind of time-frame am I looking at. This is important because I need to focus on finding replacement housing. The local government bodies either do not have or are unwilling to work with single fathers.
3. Is there anything I can do to either expunge this eviction or alleviate the fallout from it. I've spent the last 24 hours scouring the internet trying to find housing and the fact is I think this will more than likely do me in as an eviction is essentially a sentence of homelessness."

My dad had been repeating phrases and yelling in my face but I was staying silent in an effort to not lash out. After a  while, I tried to leave so that things wouldn’t escalate further but they blocked my way out. Finally, I was standing in front of my mom in the hallway and yelled that I needed to get out and I hit the wall next to me. After that, they let me leave. As I left I heard my mom screaming because i had left.

My parents were worried that I was suicidal or something so they called the police who searched for a little while but weren’t able to find me. After they were done searching, an officer talked to my parents about what had happened. He asked to see the hole and he decided that it was domestic violence.

legaladvice,"Car accident, Ohio","Hi LA:  So about a month ago, I rear-ended a woman who was turning right on a red light who slammed on her brakes in the middle of the turn, catching me completely off-guard (I was behind her and also turning right on red).  She stated she saw a car changing lanes in the middle of the intersection of the road we were turning onto and braked so she would not hit them.
We exchanged information and took photos of the damage, each other's licenses and insurance cards.  She was very nice about the whole thing.  It was like 5 mph damage and no airbags were deployed, but clearly bumpers were damaged.
We were all set to drive off and she came back to me and said her husband insisted she call the cops because apparently he had been burned somehow in an accident.  So she and I sat there and waited for an hour for a cop to show up and he gave me an assured clear distance ticket, but basically admonished the woman for calling the cops in a no-injury car crash, since information was exchanged.
My question:  was I obligated to stay at the scene of the accident or could I have driven home after all the information was exchanged and not waited an hour?  Would I have been fleeing the scene of a crime?
(I went the court and both the officer and the woman showed up: I assume the lady was kind enough to say she jammed on the brakes unexpectedly.  The prosecutor was very pleasant and after dismissing the officer and speaking with the lady, offered to dismiss the charges if I paid court costs - $130...which I did)."

legaladvice,[UT] Someone tried to sell me a stolen dog. Who can I/ who do I report this to?,"I was looking online for a dog to adopt and found an adorable Shih Tzu/ Yorkie mix. The dog was listed for $450 (reasonable for a designer breed) and I texted the ""owner."" We communicated for a few hours and she told me she had to sell the dog ASAP because her landlord found out about the dog and was going to kick them out. 

We agreed to meet at a local park. She was insistent I brought cash but other than that seemed completely normal. I asked her to bring the dog's paperwork from the breeder and a contract for us to sign so I could sign the dog up for pet insurance/ puppy training. She read that text but ignored it (she had read receipts on). I texted her that I was 5 minutes away and she read that message too. 

When I got to the park, I tried to call her to see where I should park. That's when my calls and texts stopped going through. I thought her phone had died so had my friend, who was with me, try calling too. The ""owner"" answered but then hung up when I told her it was me. She texted my friend's number that the dog was still available but she didn't have any of the paperwork I was ""demanding."" She then blocked my friend's number and removed the listing from online.

I looked her up on Instagram and turns out, she has four dogs right now (so clearly not about to be kicked out for buying a dog) and over the past year, has showcased eight different dogs on her Instagram, claiming all of them were hers. The whole situation just seems fishy and I think the dog was stolen. Who do I report that to? Can I report this to someone? Or do I just chalk it up to a weird interaction with a crappy human being?"
legaladvice,withholding rent due to no source of heat [TN],"
hey guys! so i’m kinda between a rock and a hard place right now and i could use some help. so my boyfriend and i rented a house a couple months ago after our landlady made a bunch of false promises, one of which was she was supposedly going to get us a propane tank and get it hooked up since the heat pump runs on natural gas(es). two months later that never happened. she also claimed that the house was insulated during the last renovation they did on it, my boyfriend looked under the house for something unrelated and there was zero insulation underneath the house and cold air was going straight up in there. 

onto our problem now i suppose, we’re now staying at his (unrelated, but absolutely psychotic parents) because our utilities ended up being over $500 and our power got shut off and our landlady has been harassing the absolute fuck out of him for rent money even though he’s explained a million times now that we need our utilities paid first. 

i guess basically what i’m asking is can we legally withhold rent in TN since our landlady has provided no source of heat whatsoever?


also this is irrelevant but we were like a week late paying rent in December and she threatened to evict us before Christmas...our landlady is a known drug addict so i already know she’s probably gonna try some more shady shit"

I rent from the typical college town scumbag realty group. I live in one of 6 adjoined rowhouses, and we share a back lot. It has no marked lines or anything, but it fits about 6 cars. Each unit got one of the spots. Anyway, after the new semester started, someone has been parking in my spot. I started parking in my neighbors spot (he currently does not have a car but has a spot). He's pissed at me because I am in his spot, and I think the realty group must've oversold parking permits with this new tenant because I have never had to park in a spot besides my own before. My neighbor is getting a car next month so obviously I can't keep parking in his spot. I can park on the street but I paid for the spot so I want to use it. Do I take this up with my landlord?

legaladvice,I didn't meet the deadline so he backed out of contract?,"A year or two ago I signed a contract with an author. The deal was that I'd illustrate his work (I believe it was 138 drawings.) and he'd pay for them in stages depending on how much I'd completed and sent to him. I was extremely new to the commission life, and WAY undercharged him to the begin with. He also agreed to have my name in his book to give me credit for the drawings. Everything we said to each other was over message or email, so it's all documented.

I was given a prompt to illustrate, and I had to do it in a cute, funny, creative way. While the prompts were his, I know my drawings needed a lot more thought and creativity to pull it off. A lot of the prompts just didn't make sense, but I had to make it funny anyway. My drawings were the make or break in that book, without a doubt. Which is what makes this so frustrating.

Now where I messed up:

I was going through a lot at the time. Without going into details on the why, I'll just say that the effect was the most severe depression I've ever had. Think showering once a week, eating twice a day (if that), not leaving bed until far in the afternoon, and suicidal thoughts.

When he threatened me with lawsuit, the fear managed to kick my rear into working again. I bulldozed through the rest in a handful of days.

I told him that I didn't expect the last payment. I said that if I didn't stick to the contract, then I didn't expect him to. 

I just remembered that whole thing recently, and looked it up to see what became of the book. It has 4 stars on Amazon, with a decent number of reviews. 

And my name is nowhere to be found. 

He made it seem as though he did it himself. Granted, it's not my best work. And simplified, though expressive, cartoons aren't exactly what I want to be known by. But I'd hoped it would lead people to searching for me online. Now I have nothing to show for 138 drawings but half of what I'd initially thought I'd be paid. What are my options?"
legaladvice,California PFL Denied Due to Payroll Issue,"Hello I’m having a problem with my California EDD PFL payment and I need some advice. 

I was approved by EDD for payments to cover a portion of my income for 6 weeks, with the understanding from my employer that they would offset my EDD payment with banked PTO to make each check whole. Employer also offers 10 days paid paternity leave to all employees. 

Went on leave and submitted my information to the state the day my child was born, received benefits computation letter 20 days letter, followed by a denial letter today. I was denied because my employer paid me my full check a few weeks ago. 

They admitted this past week they made a mistake and that I would receive reduced check for the next few pay periods to offset the overage...

How should I deal with this issue? I now won’t receive a full check till the end of Feb and won’t be able to get anything from the state to make my check whole. This is clearly a problem that was caused by my payroll department and while I do have a ton of pto that could make all of these checks whole, I don’t want to burn my hard earned time because of their mistakes. 

The appeals process for the state looks like it could take at least 2 months before getting payment. But I will be long off my paternity leave and back to work. 

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated."
legaladvice,Question about rent increase,"I live in Cincinnati Ohio with my fiance, who's a medical student. Our current lease for an apartment ends April 30th. Our apartment building got sold 2 months ago (during our current lease agreement). Our new landlord has stated that rent is going up almost 50%. Our current lease has a holdover clause that says if you don't renew your lease rent goes up 10% on a month to month basis. We're in the market for a new house but probably won't be able to close before April 30th and as a result will need one more month in our current residence. We're not strapped for cash but it is pretty tight, is there any reason that the new ownership should have to honor the holdover clause in our current lease? Or are we basically SOL?"

legaladvice,TX: Managing two roommates that are breaking the law in an apartment,"This post is made in stead of a friend of mine, I’m willing to use my account for this, and I’m assisting her and her boyfriend in their decision making process moving forward.

She (22F) is living with her mother, her cousin, and her brother. Her boyfriend (18M) lives with his family, who is willing to take her in, but there’s a few issues.

1.) Her name and her mother’s name is on the lease.

2.) Literally everyone but her is smoking cigarettes and marijuana in the apartment.

3.) She’s financially strapped due to her mother stealing from her for a while and the theft of her car.

So, this all known, what’s her best avenue of recourse in this situation? She won’t be able to afford the inevitable fees required to restore the apartment to it’s original state. Her mother intends to move to Washington ASAP, thus leaving her responsible for the impending costs as her mother would be unaffected by the credit impact of defaulting on the fees. 

My suggestion was to try to get off the lease (switch with the cousin) under the guise of moving out with the BF but still providing her monthly rent for the apartment until the lease is up, which would leave the costs on those who made the decision to incur the costs.

What do you guys think?

Thanks. :)"

legaladvice,How “closed” are closed adoptions? [CA],"In 1980, when I was 16 years old, I gave birth to a baby boy in the state of California. The father of the baby never knew of his existence and isn't named on the birth certificate. It was a closed adoption done through a Catholic adoption agency.

Since then, I’ve moved quite a ways away from my hometown and had four more kids (all of whom I’ve kept). I haven’t told any of my kids or either of the men I’ve been married to about this baby. I didn't think of him a whole lot after my high school years, to be honest.

But lately, I’ve been getting these weird nervous feelings/concerns out of nowhere that this kid (he’d now be almost 40) is going to come knocking on my door, and let my family know of my secret. I don’t know why, it’s just been kind of a random thing that has popped up and gets me fearful. This would throw a huge wrench into my life and I would be way more stress than I could possibly handle. Thinking about it really piques my anxiety.

legaladvice,Auto Collision Insurance Dispute,"Hey guys,

It’s my first time being in this situation, as I’ve never been involved in any sort of auto accidents. Long story short, I was sideswiped in an intersection today and was not at fault, the other party ran a red light. We exchanged information and she tried to deny fault but when I was adamant my light was green began to backtrack and say she thought her light was green.
I called the police after she didn’t want to and just wanted to exchange information. I was told because there were no injuries, everyone was cooperative, and the vehicles could still drive, that no officer would be sent. I immediately after the situation called my insurance about it and they told me my options but since the other party was at fault, to file a claim with them. So, I did that.
A little while later I was called to get a statement and I was told that the other party couldn’t make their statement today but upon initial contact was “surprised” a claim had been filed. (...surprised? Isn’t filing a claim what you do after an accident? Am I being punked?) They said that since there was no police report and no other involved parties, that if the other person denies fault it will be my word against theirs and they will side with their driver. 
Immediately after that I drove to the police station and filed a report, where they said that no other reports had been filed about it or other notifications.
So the other driver never filed a claim, never reported anything to the police, and didn’t want to even get them involved. I know it’s the insurance company’s job to not have to pay out, but is there anything I can do to get this further in my direction? I have pictures of the damages, where it happened, and am canvassing the local businesses in the intersection to see if anyone has security camera footage (would pretty much seal the deal), but in case they don’t, is there anything I can do if the insurance company rules in favor of the other driver?

legaladvice,Inappropriate Company Owner,"Hello. Burner account, because obviously. 

I’ve got quite the situation at work and I really don’t know how to handle it.  I work at a very public facing organization and the owner is an immature child.  Not only does he rant and rave and mother-f you if you mess up - he can be pretty aggressive with sexual jokes and women.

My direct report (Female FWIW)  has an existing working relationship with the owner. Because of this he thinks it’s appropriate to come by her desk and gossip with her and make really inappropriate jokes. He also makes a lot of inappropriate comments to her about other women in the company.  Ones that make everyone that is nearby uncomfortable and are definitely not professional or appropriate. He’s even made sex jokes about me and my sex life.  It’s just gross and annoying and obnoxious.  

I know she wants it to stop but She doesn’t want to blow it up into a big deal. Worse - he is the type of person that if She even says “stop that’s not appropriate” that it won’t make things better - it will probably make it worse.  

As her manager I am worried that it’s starting to get to the point where I am complicit if I don’t say anything and eventually something gets reported.  Additionally, I want it to stop. It’s gross and incredibly unprofessional. But by making a report or complaint I’m basically ruining my career there and maybe even in other places because he’s that vindictive.  Also, our HR person is really not good and will be of 0 use. He reports to the owner and will do nothing to protect me. 

So - What can I do?  I know retaliation laws exist to protect you, but in reality, there isn’t much protection from them making my life hell for my remaining time. I could maybe talk to my direct boss but it’s not gonna make much of a change. 

Also. I don’t really want to engage in that fight. I do want to protect my employee and myself. I’m worried she’s going to get sick of him - file a suit - and I’ll go down with the jackass for not doing anything...

Also. He’s the owner. You can’t fire the owner."

legaladvice,Can I sue the State or File a claim if their construction trucks caused me to be Rear Ended?," 

Is there any potential action that can be taken against state construction trucks that had one lane on a dual lane highway shutdown without any signs or warnings other then the flashing arrows on their trucks?

I was rear ended a few days ago, as far as I can tell, I have no injuries, nor the person who hit me.

State construction trucks on an interstate in Rhode Island had the right lane shut down, in a construction zone, but not in an area with actual construction. There were no signs or warnings of the lane being closed, just 4 trucks all within visual distance of each other. Cars in the right lane were jamming on their breaks and pushing into the left lane, causing my lane of travel to go from 65 mph to less then 25.

The moment I was hit the truck that had the lane shut down moved off to the break down lane and let cars pass. All of the trucks drove off before police arrived to the scene.

The party who hit me's insurance has already accepted 100% liability.

legaladvice,Using the names of tv shows in an app / website that you make money from,"I’m thinking of creating an app that will be free to use but I will run ads within it to make money. Within the app I will be talking about tv shows.

If I was to create something that was more of a discussion thing about the tv show, could I legally use the name of the tv show as a listing. So people can search that tv show and it would pop up within my app?

The app will not be named anything to do with the tv show, it will just be a “search for discussions relating to this tv show” type of thing. 

What do I need to be careful about when talking about the tv show? It will be spoiler heavy, and will reference the characters and what they get up to. I know there’s a thing about deformation of character type of thing saying I can’t slate the tv show, but if people are slating it and i write about it... is that a problem?

legaladvice,"My old boss kept me on payroll after I quit, and was fired for embezzlement","Location is in Mississippi.

Hey Reddit, just wanted to get some advice on a unique situation I've run into. I don't want to break any rules here so I'm just going to keep it vague.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long story short, I worked for a major retailer back in 2018. This specific retailer also fixes phones, computers, etc. I worked for them previously as well, but I decided to come back for something temporary while switching jobs. After I quit in December of 2018, I started my new job that same month.

Not long ago I heard that the stores GM was fired for keeping employees that had left the company on payroll so that way his turn over rate was low. These payments would range anywhere from a couple cents, to a couple dollars. Honestly, I didn't think much of it and really wasn't all that concerned.

As of this morning I've received a W-2 from said company for the amount of $60+, and I'm not sure what to do with it. I don't want to be involved in the situation, and was never even notified that I was apparently involved in the first place.

What should I do? Ignore the W-2? Contact the company? I've never had to deal with this before so I'm sort of lost."
legaladvice,"Ex girlfriend being harassed and threatened, doesn’t want to go to police because she doesn’t think they’ll do anything. Is there anything I can do to help?","Hopefully this is the right place for this, if not I’d appreciate a point in the right direction!

Basically, my ex gf (24) recently got out of a relationship with her physically abusive boyfriend *(not me I’m a good person I swear ask my mom)*. He beat her on a few separate occasions, until she finally got the courage to leave him a few months ago. She recently had to change her number and blocked him on social media because he was threatening to straight up kill her, and even went as far as to drive to her house and demand she come outside the other night.

She refuses to go to the police because she doesn’t have faith that they’d be able to do anything about it, but she’s truly scared for her life. This guy has already gone to jail for domestic abuse against his own mother, and from my limited interaction with him exhibits major sociopathic traits. 

Even when they were dating, my ex’s sister and I could NOT get my ex to report the abuse she was receiving to the police, so it sadly makes a bit of sense to me as to why she wouldn’t report the harassment she’s getting. However, we have a child together who spends most of the time in her care, and I’m not only fearful for her but also want to protect my son from this lunatic. 

Is there anything I can do? I’m scared her theories about the police are right but I just want to make sure. We live in Iowa if that helps any.

TL;DR - My ex’s abusive ex-bf is stalking and threatening her life, she refuses to go to the police and just hopes he stops. I want to do something about it because I care about her safety and our child is involved."

I've been working FT again for about 5 months now after two years of PT freelance work that was less than 1/3 of my previous salary on my last FT job. So, I fell into the trap of floating myself with revolving debt, and got in way over my head. At one point, I got put on the hardship program, and they cut my interest rate way down, but even the minimum payments were more than my mortgage.

I was advised by My CPA to stop paying on those cards, and most of the people who I've talked to said that once they get charged off and the collection agencies buy the debt, all they can do is nag the hell out of you and ruin your credit. I've also heard that making any contact with them about the debt restarts it, and since this all got charged off almost 2 years ago, I just planned on waiting it out.

legaladvice,Simple employment law question regarding Pennsylvania.,"A friend of mine is leaving their job and has not given notice yet. We reviewed the contract to see if any unused PTO would be paid (they would rather have the money, but if they won’t be paid on it, they’ll use some days). The total days accrued is somewhere in the 5-7 range. The language states that unused PTO would be paid at the next pay period unless specific state law states otherwise. From a quick Google search it looks like PA does not require employers to pay PTO at all (correct me if I’m wrong). This is a national company and the language was in the general Employee Handbook. There’s no mention of it in the job specific offer letter. 

The CEO is definitely the type to try to avoid paying anything he doesn’t absolutely need to. So I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t pay for unused PTO in states where it’s not required. However, the language could suggest that all unused PTO will be paid, but WHEN it will be paid is dictated by state.

Also just to add, it does state that it won’t be paid out if you fail to give 2 weeks notice, and that you can’t give your 2 weeks and proceed to use all your PTO during that time. So of course my friend is hoping to strategize any time they may want to use before they approach the 2 week mark, but would rather get the check if that is legally required.

Is anyone familiar with PA employment law and can give some insight?

Our rental company is a classic slum lord college town rental company with a pseudo “don’t ask don’t tell policy” meaning that they’ll look away for anything we do at the apartment against the law (underage drinking, smoking indoors) as long as we don’t make a huge fuss for subprime living conditions.

My reasoning behind this is that she was always and still is very abusive, cunning, sly and manipulative. The proofs are that when she and my dad got divorced, (I was 8 at the time) the court made me live with her and I was living hell, she would constantly throw parties every two or three days(she got the money from selling the apartment where we used to live in, even though my dad didn't want to), during the time I lived with her, I couldn't properly study because I couldn't sleep during  all of the parties, she would physically and mentally abuse me because I didn't get good grades(at that time I already had a little brother who lived the same life). After that she ran out of money so she was depending on her at the time boyfriend and we moved to another city, then ahe broke up with him and we were literally broke, we depended on the alimony my dad had to pay her and her wage which was very little. She was still spending most of the money on alcohol(during the time I lived with her I always wanted to live with my dad, but he couldn't do anything because the court decided that I had to live with my mom). At the time she was very aggresive towards my dad. Once when she was drinking I saw my 2 year old brother drinking her beer and she said ""he can have it"". The first time I ran away from her, I was 10 and I had a pet chinchilla and a dog, so after I got out of the house she started shouting from the window that she is going to throw the dog and the chinchilla out of the window, when I got out I called my grandma because she lived quite near me, if i could stay at her place, and then my cousin picked me up and drove me to my grandmas place. Later that day I really regretted not taking my brother with me.
The next day my dad drove 2 hours so that he could talk to me and then he took me back to her, because he couldn't really do much, he lived quite far and had lots of work. So the next year was basically the same but we moved to another apartment. So when I was 11, I got really tired of her and one winter morning, though I had to go to school, I went to my grandmas workplace and after I met her I told her everything, she was shocked, so we instantly went to CPS, I told them everything that she has done, and the granted temporary custody to my grandma. I lived with her for a few months and I have to say even though we didn't have a lot of money, I lived some of my best days there, mainly because she was a really nice person and she had a cat. Even though my mom wws constantly coming to my school and beghing me to come back. So at the end of the year my dad got granted custody of me and I was really happy. After all that my life got much better. More recently my mom moved to the UK, and I have been visiting her in summer. First year it was calm. The second year she started drinking and broke up with her boyfriend so I went back later than I expected. Last year, she got really abusive, she made me buy her alcohol, she promised that I would get home before my birthday, but I barely did thanks to my dad who was really angry when I got back because he had to pay a lot of money to get me back. But I understood him(he has a mortgage and a car bill to pay, but he and my stepmom split the bill, so that they can pay the bills, buy food etc.). It was actually the first time in my life that I said that I loved him. So now my mom keeps harrasing me for not wanting to talk to her, and keeps telling me that she will text my girlfriend and her mom to say that I ignore my relatives and don't talk to her, even though I talk to my relatives from time to time. She keeps saying that I'm ungrateful for everything that she's given me. I'm really sad for my 2 brothers that live with her, because she's even more abusive towards them that she was to me. She brainwashes them that their dad is a really bad person. Even though I'm 16 at the time, I want to know if there is anything possible to do now or when I turn 18.
I forgot to mention that she would lie to the CPS in the UK and back here that we live a good life, that she is a perfect mom and she only wants the best life for her children.

TL;DR Is there anyway to disown my abusive, manipulative, cunning and sly mother, who ruined most of my life."
legaladvice,"Diagnosed dementia, making legal and financial decisions.","My father-in-law was diagnosed with Parkinsonian Dementia in August. We discovered that in October he had worked with his lawyer and made an amendment to his trust, and that more recently he has been calling his financial institutions and moving money around. His trust amendment included adding a non-family member to his inheritance. What legal ramifications/limitations would his lawyer and his financial companies need to abide by because of his diagnosis? Can someone with diagnosed dementia make legal changes to their trusts and manage their money? He lives in California, we live in Oregon.
My wife is listed as the first individual that can gain control of his trust if he is no longer capable, and we are working on trying to satisfy those requirements, but as of now we don't have any legal control. Could we contact those financial companies/lawyers and inform them of his reduced mental capacity, and would they then be required to stop taking orders from him? Can a dementia patient enter into legal contracts?
We are concerned that this non-family member has been taking advantage of him and his current state. We want to make sure that his estate is available to pay for his managed care, and not squandered."
legaladvice,Wage discrepancy,"My girlfriend has worked at the same agency for three years. In 2019, she received a raise (3-4% or something like that) and worked a few extra hours every week on special projects that paid a fixed amount. She doesn't necessarily pay attention to her paystubs, as a lot of people don't, and was surprised to see that her gross pay for 2019 was a few hundred dollars less than it was 2018. She is trying to figure out what to do. At present, she is planning to sit down with the director to discuss it and ask for it to be looked into. After that, we have no idea.

Some factors that may be involved or indicate relevant factors: In December things got a little strange. Annual bonuses were delayed with no explanation, mileage reimbursements were late, and no pay stubs were given. I don't now if that means that no pay was submitted, for her, to the government, or what. In any event, something is clearly not right.

Any advice is greatly appreciated."

legaladvice,Can my landlord legally require me to confront and control my roommate? (threatening 10 day eviction) (Extra Long),"Moved into a new home legitimately with an acquaintance.  I was made aware, by the landlord,  after passing credit and backing checks and signing the lease and moving into the home on the first day the landlord asked me to take charge of the home (not the verbal agreement made with my roommate, we agreed he's head off household he's been here a long time)

She politely asked me to really remind him and tell him he needs to clean more.  I have yet to see anything I would call an urgent mess, it's cleaner than any other home I've moved into the last 5 times, (w/exceptions) but its still a bachelor's home with a minor mess.  Otherwise, she told me, he's already been warned about it and they can and will evict him within 10 days.

This broke me, I was just there to pick up parking permit for my car window so I was there in person and started crying, fully hyperventilating.  I dont need that on my record and I can't control others nor do I want to control anyone.  I can't trust them anyways, every time I trust a simple promise like why would someone steal your jeans, guess what got stolen?  I just want peace, to go to work and go home and relax, I'll clean what I use, and then some and I definitely am a bit of a clean freak (she now knows this).  I don't use the kitchen much however.

So to bring this to a concluding question.  Can she require me to control my roommate and clean up and go through his personal space to appease the landlord?

She was really apologetic for even mentioning it but now I have fear of eviction going on MY record for something I wasn't aware of (I was mentioned the ding on his record for a broken recliner he just hadn't been able to move) but not this eviction threat.  She promised I would be protected but if life has taught me anything, promises are worth the paper they are written on.  Sometimes that may be written but it's still worthless.  

I did decline it obviously in no position to discuss these types of matters now just rivers flowing through my eyes cause life sucks.  

I just don't know what to do.  Do I run?  Put in my notice now before something happens?  If it's bad it will happen to me, and fast.  Do I break the lease immediately and run now?  Given my history I feel there's no way to protect myself and I can't keep recovering from other people fking me, directly or indirectly.

I have no promises in any writing, how do I protect myself from others or from my landlord?  No home is affordable solo.  How do I avoid an eviction?

This is all happening in the midst of living in my car recovering just enough from a Craigslist scam where the person on a lease rented out his rooms to pay the ""rent"" instead ran off and we found ourselves dealing with his eviction already in progress to the point of police notice to escort everyone off the property.  None of our records hurt.  Almost 2000 dollars stolen, I have a picture of his ID, and a written contract police won't help there and it's been 3 days, no word from the DA either.  (Sent an email)

Edit: sorry if I'm slow to respond, I'm using mobile I'm not fully moved in yet, and exhausted, having been sleeping in my car, and crying I'll likely fall asleep watching this post.  I'm bad at reddit.  Please be nice."
legaladvice,Is a lawyer neccessary for an adult adoption?,"Hi, Im in Tennessee. My son who's 19 wants his stepfather to adopt him and change his name. From what i could learn online this is a fairly simple procedure between the two of them that would require them to fill out the proper forms, file them and receive a court date. I read to just go to our clerks office and they can provide me the forms to fill out and file, no lawyer needed. Its a smaller town and the clerks office looked at me like i had 2 heads and had no idea what forms I would need. So I've set up an appointment with the only adoption attorney in our county. Is this the best route to go or should i have been able to do it myself? Thanks for any advice"
legaladvice,Can it be considered defamation if I tell a story that is “based on a true story” and paint someone in a negative light?,"I’ve been increasingly bothered lately by the lack of conversation about police brutality and other unprofessional behaviour from police in Australia. I really want to contribute to starting this conversation. And I have stories that I want to share. 

I would be telling these stories as narratives “based on a true story” because I’m not normally physically present when these stories take place. (That said, I do often get both sides second hand - the cops’ side and the civilians’ side). And I also intend to change the names of everyone involved. 

Let’s say I tell the story of one black kid I know who gave a cop a friendly nudge to say hello at a community carols event and then got arrested because apparently that was “disrespectful” so the kid deserved to be publicly shamed in front of 2000 onlookers in a highly visible arrest to teach him a lesson. 

Just say I change the cop’s name but keep his rank for my story without giving away the town. Only those in the know would be able to work out who the character was based on. But for those in the know it would be very very obvious. 

Clearly I’ll be presenting this cop’s actions in a fairly negative way because... it’s a pretty horrible thing to do to a kid just to stroke your own ego. I’m just wondering where do I stand, and can I get in trouble for telling a story that (to those in the know) is clearly based on him?"
legaladvice,[NY] What is my best legal option to keep my mother away from me?,"Every few months, my mother (55) will start hours-long arguments with me (22) that push me to suicidal thoughts- I'm never seriously depressed or consider suicide until she decides it's time to stir up a fight. She was and is a terrible mother and person (none of her 7 siblings talk to her, none of her 30+ nieces/nephews, she has a relationship with 1 of her 8 grandchildren, and her 7 children appease her here and there if they haven't already cut her off). I'm new to this thread and will try to objectively described the situation, but I'm also incredibly stressed out, so I apologize if this post includes more drama/description than necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get a restraining order, but my living situation is complicated. I live with my older sister (30), her son (5), my younger brother (17), and younger sister (14), in my older sister's house. My mother is unable (and possibly unwilling) to house my younger siblings, so they sleep on couches here; I've lived here since I started college because my sister needed help with her son and lives only 10min from my school. Anyways, I don't know if getting a restraining order is the most efficient thing I can do here considering it's not my house and I live with siblings- I don't wanna put unnecessary stress on them. I fully intend on moving in the few months following my graduation in May anyways, but my mom is only happy if I'm miserable, so I don't know what I can do until then.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I even get a restraining order? She doesn't physically harm me (anymore), but she will lie and try to manipulate me for literally hours, and won't just leave the house because it's my sister's house, not mine. I could stay in my room the whole time, avoiding her, and she will literally come up and start a fight with me; triggering me is a passion of hers. Should I just begin leaving the house whenever she invites herself over? I would hate to do that to my siblings, but I cannot stress enough how bad she is for my mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I get a restraining order as soon as possible? Would it be better to get one once I move out as to not affect anyone else? Is there anything I can do in the meantime for the sake of my mental health?

&amp;#x200B;

Additional issues that I could use some legal advice on:

I almost completely financially support my two younger siblings and my mother refuses to help me in any way (I pay for doctors appointments, groceries, plus all the gas that goes into driving them around). I work part-time and make minimum wage, is there anything I can do to get her to pay me for even a third of the money I spend on my siblings?

My car is under her name, but only because it was under my dad's, but he suddenly passed away. Because of this, she constantly threatens to take the plates off of my car and refuse to give me the title to put it under my name- is that legal? What could I do if she does that? I paid for the car and have been driving it for 3-4yrs and honestly only need it until I move in a few months."

legaladvice,Unusable room in apartment due to water damage,"Hi everyone,

A couple weeks ago while I was out of town there was a big storm that hit our area. Water went entirely through my bedroom from the apartment above me and into the one below. It destroyed my bed and my bedding, and I understand I can’t do anything about that.

However, I now have a room in my one bedroom apartment that I cannot use. The ceiling is covered in mildew and has the ceiling fan still on the floor. I can’t walk in there without having an allergy attack.

This room is unlivable. February rent is coming up, and they have done nothing to rectify the situation since it needs to dry. I don’t want to pay for an apartment that I can’t even fully use. I sleep on my couch and essentially have a studio now. I do not want to pay full price.

I was forced to sign an agreement (By the government agency) not to disclose anything then laid off shortly after.

I began interviewing for a position I was very qualified for, first with a phone interview then with 3 in person interviews.  It was a very positive experience and I felt as though they agreed I was a perfect fit.

Following my interview, I received a call with some concern. They had come across an article and or court documents that outlined the allegations.  The prospective employer was concerned and wanted to know my involvement in these allegations.  I explained that I was never involved with the part of the business in court (which was only 10% of company revenue)

It was bad enough that I was let go but also that I am now having to explain their actions that I was unaware of while employed.

It felt inappropriate but I wasn't sure if pending litigation between my former employer and the Government could be used to disqualify me for a new position."
legaladvice,[Wake County NC] Eviction Process,"So I foolishly took in a friend as a tenant in the condo I live in. We discussed the particulars before hand and drew up a lease to match the specifics we discussed. At the time I knew his pay schedule was a bit irregular, but was told that the rent we agreed upon was more than doable (in fact a decrease from the rent he was paying before). As such, I allowed him to move in without paying the first month's rent upfront and was assured that I would be paid the very next week. Well the week came and went and no pay was given despite the tenant repeatedly saying he had income (supposedly he was paid by his job and sold his old vehicle). Ultimately after the second week I told him that I needed to issue him a Notice to Quit or Pay as a formality (giving him 11 days) and did so at the close of the week (2nd week of the lease). 

This Monday will be the 11th day and I'm seriously suspecting that eviction might be coming up in my near future. On the chance that this tenant in fact does not quit and does not pay my understanding is that I will have to go through the formal eviction process. My question is if there is anything I've missed in this process, does my presence in the house or the fact I've received no rent at all present any options for expediting the eviction process?

Likewise I'd like to ask what I should expect from the eviction process if it goes that way, cost and time estimates would be greatly appreciated.

legaladvice,Kicked out no notice and he has my property,"I live part time in Indiana but am a resident of Texas. Let me start by saying that the only person on the apartment lease is my ex-friend, however I was paying him to allow me to stay at his place when I was in town. I travel for work. Maybe live there at most 10 days out of the month—but I have personal belongings there. Call me a freeloader or boarder, whatever you want.

One day he sends a text and says I’m no longer welcome to his apartment and that he won’t be responding to me. The reason he kicked me out according to his text was NOT due to missed payments, damaged property, or any illegal act on my part. I have proof of wired payment. It was just a doomed friendship and “he just didn’t want to share a common space anymore”. Whatever. I get it. he could’ve handled it differently though instead of leaving me without a place to sleep.

He said he would drop my property off but won’t tell me when. And he won’t respond when I inquire about my property (or about anything for that matter). 

1) Is he allowed to hold my property? 

2) Was he allowed to kick me out without advanced notice? 

3) What if he claims he dropped of my property but I never actually receive it? (this is something I can almost bet on)

4) What should I do and how long should I wait before taking more action? 

5) Would calling his landlord and telling her that he’s been letting me live there without her knowing help me leverage my things?

legaladvice,[NC] Storage locker company declares Chap 7 bankruptcy with our stuff still in storage,"We received a 309C form in the mail yesterday that our storage locker property owners had filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy case in a US District Court.
  
About 8 months ago, we sold our house. The new location was out of state, smaller, and temporary, so we didn't want to move big items.  We found a moving company and they came and packed up larger furniture items. The move itself went flawlessly.  Our big items were going to be placed at their on-site storage facility until we needed them moved to our new location.  We made monthly on-time payments on the storage locker via credit card over the last 8 months.  The most recent payment, was about 2 weeks ago.  We've never visited the storage facility as we're currently living several states away.

The 309C form was filed at the beginning of this last week.  The form came in an envelope with the return address of the storage company.  No other information was provided.  The local company is ""independently owned and operated"" but was under the banner of a major moving company. 

So we're not sure why we got the 309C but we're concerned that our stuff is going to be liquidated as a part of the chapter 7 bankruptcy of the storage company. 

So, 

Are we considered creditors?

Should we contact the Bankruptcy trustee for more information?
 
Should we contact the debtor's (storage company) attorney for more information?

Do we / should we attend the meeting of creditors next month?
Should we continue to make payments on the storage locker over the next few months?

Should we contact the affiliated major moving chain umbrella company? 

If our stuff is damaged now, is there any recourse other than credit card company or major moving chain?"
legaladvice,Landlord issues. Legal help?,"It's hard to write this because I never thought I'd be one of those people who asked the internet for help. But here I am. 

To the lawyers/cops/anyone that's gone through something similar:

My landlord is a slumlord. She never keeps up with the house and often gives off a ""figure it out yourself"" attitude when it comes to any issues on the property. For instance, I recently found mold all over an area of the home and when I contacted her about the issue, she took days to respond and told me I was wrong (despite photographs proving otherwise). Oh yeah, and I've been consistently ill for 3 months straight. Which is weird considering I couldn't even tell you the last time I had a cold before moving onto this property. The mold addendum section of the lease dictates that the owner must deem if the house is inhabitable due to this issue, but how can that happen if they don't even answer our texts? A family member suggested I go to the doctors for a blood test because apparently they can tell if that's what's making me ill. I'm not a doctor though, and neither are they, and I also don't trust just googling it.

Another issue is with a roommate. She's become violent (like damaging property in the common area when black out drunk and then responding with ""once you have evidence of me doing it we'll talk"") and likes to threaten to fight us. When we told the landlord about how we felt unsafe and how we (the other roommates) will not be paying for the damages that she causes, she told us we're all responsible nonetheless. Asshole.

My issue is this: the violent roommate is not even on the lease. She sublet from someone and they never turned the paperwork in, and per the lease, a resident cannot sublet to another individual without EXPLICIT WRITTEN PERMISSION from the landlord - which was never received. Police reports were filed for the damaged property for later documentation but technically, no criminal activity has taken place. The cop advised me that I can't do anything unless I'm physically assaulted and I'm not *too* keen on getting into an altercation, but will if I have to defend myself and my other roommates.

Do we have any legal ground for termination? Civil suits against the landlord/roommate? Or are we fucked because we technically signed a legal document binding us to the property and all the baggage that comes with it? Any advice is welcome. (Other than calling the police because we were advised there was nothing they could do even if she's caught destroying property)."
legaladvice,"Car bought ""as is"" and broke down immediately. Can I do anything?","I'm in the state of Virginia, if there's any relevant laws. 

About a week ago I bought a car for $1700 from a small dealership. The battery was dead but they jumpstarted the car and let me take it for a test drive. The car ran fine, aside from a soft brake pedal, but it had to be jumpstarted.

The dealer took it to a mechanic to look it over, and when I called them they said the mechanic told them the car was fine, the battery was just dead. The car had also passed inspection. I bought the car the same week, and signed papers acknowledging the car was sold as is. 

Less than a week after, I was driving the car and the power steering suddenly died out and the car started overheating. The power steering pulley had broke, and the serpentine belt had come loose. After I had it fixed the radiator started leaking, so I had to get that fixed too. 

My mother called the dealership, and they told her that they had told me multiple times that the car had issues and that I ignored them and insisted on buying it. I know for a fact that they had told me a mechanic said the car was fine. My brother and his girlfriend were also present when I bought the car, and neither of them heard the dealer mention any issues about the car, nor were any issues written down.

So what I'm wondering is, is there anyway I can take the dealer to court or small claims court and get at least some of my money back? Could it be considered fraud that they told me the car was fine, but now claim they told me it had issues? Or am I just out of luck and have to look for a new car?

Any advice appreciated.

legaladvice,I was supposed to be cleared for school since the beginning of the month but I’m still not in school. NJ,"Before I start I wanna say I’m not sure if this is where I post this, sorry about formatting, and sorry if the title didn’t make sense. Not sure if this is important but I’m 15.

So for the past year I’ve been in and out of the hospital and partial programs for depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I would say that I’ve made a lot of progress throughout the year and I believe I’m ready to go back to school. I’ve already missed about a year and a half of school and I don’t want to continue like that. I’ve spoken with DCPMP around December and they said they would work out me trying to get into school. I’m supposed to get a paper saying that I’m “cleared” for school. The thing is they keep my and my mother in the dark about all of this. Ever since December I haven’t heard a single thing from them. Not a phone call, text, or a letter. Then we did hear from my social worker, I believe, and he had arranged a meeting with me and my mom at home. Then he didn’t show up that day. We waited a few days and heard nothing. And that’s how it’s been up until now. Whenever we call them we don’t get an answer. I want to know what I can do. I’ve tried just going to school without it to see what would happen. But then I just got pulled out at lunch time saying I needed that paper. But I didn’t have it so I was just in the office the whole day. Is there a way I can go to school without it? What do I do if they’re not in contact with us? Is it illegal for them to keep us “in the dark”? I don’t know what to do at all."
legaladvice,"Physically threatened by co-worker, options?","This occurred in an at will state

I was directly threatened by a co-worker in front of the general manager. This was unprovoked, my manager knows this. The offending individual was sent home for the rest of the day and the day after, then allowed to return to work. Now I am being told I will have to work one on one with this individual. 

I don't think it's in my best interest and safety to continue with my employment. If I voluntarily leave do I have any chance at unemployment. I'm not looking for any kind of protracted legal thing. I just want out and to move on. Of course I don't have another job lined up at the moment. Do I have any other options? Or do I just have to suck it up and leave?

I tried to convey just the gist of it without doxxing myself, I'll answer whatever I can without doing that.

legaladvice,"Mother recently died, her ex husband posting false info and harassing my family (NV)","This is in Las Vegas, NV. My mother died a few days ago due to complications from pneumonia. Her ex husband (not my father, but has been taking advantage of my father) has been taking over her Facebook account (can't memorialize it yet because they rejected the hospital documents) and posting things as her to hurt the family. He is homeless and jobless so he's been doing this any time he can get to an internet connection at all hours of the day and night, so it's hard to follow where he's posting things.     
   
He's been harassing my aunt as well as my elderly grandmother via text message from different numbers, calling them names and blaming them for her death. He's also taken to putting up his own version of obituaries for her on different websites, despite the information being incorrect, and making her look bad. I've been reporting these to their respective websites but other than that, is there a legal way to get him to stop and leave us alone to grieve?  
  
I don't know if there's any legal thing I can do, can or if I should just keep cleaning up behind him. Thank you, legaladvice."
legaladvice,"Going through a dissolution, need help with custody!","Just received certified mail from where my wife got all the dissolution papers notarized. Very difficult to receive in and of itself. But we have a three year old son, and in it she states she “wants full custody” and that child is “primarily in mothers care”. 

This is alarming to me for a couple reasons:

1). We *always* agreed that either one of us weren’t going for full custody, and thought we were still standing by that. 

2). My son HAS NOT been primarily living with her. He has been with me more than half the time (easily) and when he is “with her” it’s with her mom, where she was living until recently. 

I am very confused and upset, and I need to know how to fight this. I know a lawyer is best but I am so so broke even by regular standards. 

Please, anything."
legaladvice,OR/USA taking my old rental agency to small claims court and need help figuring out how much for.,"I rented a home from a 3rd party rental agency from June 2016 to December 2019. When we moved in there were some problems with the home but we were living in our van before so we figured we could look past them. Our home was built in 1905 and was a cute little farmhouse in the country, perfect for gardening like we wanted and our rent was $950 plus utilities. 

When we moved in there were certain repairs that we were told would be fixed, some did and others did not. Over time when we would have an issue come up we would do the online message or call (neither of which came with receipts mind you), and again some would get fixed and others weren't. In the May of 2018 we had a kid and coincidentally our states renting laws changed. Without any notification our due by date changed from the 9th to the 4th, and our late fee went from $50 to $100. There were a few times we thought we paid on time but didn't and even on the other months (not notified of late fee) they would take our months rent and use some of it to pay the remaining balance of the late fees before, then we would have an even bigger remaining balance, and so on. Five days before September 1st I got my first notice of this change when the agencies owner called me to tell me if we didn't have another $500 with our rent than we would be evicted. I bawled as I tried to explain we had no idea and that she would be evicting me and my five month old to the streets to which she coldly replied, ""well it sounds to me like you can't afford to live there and should find another place to live."" I broke down, I already had post partum but this just really broke me. My fiance (now ex important later) ended up emailing back in forth with her and getting our late fees reduced, to $150 which we paid. 
In September we have an annual inspection and this time we were adament that our fixes be made. We had a new baby and that woman basically tried to evict us for her own mistake so we went through in a lot of detail. The biggest being that there was a leak in the roof of the mainbedroom and mold was starting to build. We were told that they would come to fix the roof but we would have to move everything out of the room. I had a C-section 5 months earlier and had the incision re-tear = 6months physical therapy.. We called, did the online portal and texted when we got the room empty but no one came. We shared a 10x 15 room that was specifically not a bedroom with our son because the other room felt like it would fall through since there was no support beam. This was for 9 months. 

In September 2019 our inspection came again and this time the repairs had really added up. Bathroom sink drain didn't work, the kitchen light was hanging from the wires, room had more mold, the other room had started separating from the stairs and bounced when you walked in. Our other problems they weren't resolving became a problem with our toddler (no handrail on stairs, 6 broken sockets, broken glass on Wood stove) and I was adamant that they get fixed. I walked the inspection lady through the whole home and she basically told me to move out because the home was so dangerous. 

Meanwhile from December 2018 to that point my now ex decided that drugs were more important than paying rent. I was doing the sahm thing, and had no idea money was getting out of hand until February 2019 when once again I got my first notification being you haven't paid rent in two months and if you don't have $2900 by March 1st we'll evict you. I get my family to help pay it and I foolishly give my fiance another chance. When I get the response for my September 2019 home repair response it's just another rundown of how much money I apparently owe because my ex lied and said he paid it but didn't. Forced to go the the DHS and get the whole works of welfare I get advice to explain to the rental agency what I'm going through is a form of abuse and to please work with me to get my ex off the lease. This would not only get me away from him but qualify me for help paying my rent while I get back on me feet. They tell me no. I have the DHS call, they tell the DHS no, and I'm forced to keep living with someone that spends all his money on drugs basically propping him up with the benefits meant for me and our son after he couldn't. 

I keep trying to find a job that will work with my childcare needs and a new place over the next few months. In the meantime my outlet upstairs starts to smoke in my sleep one night and I get insomnia for the next month, trying desperately to get a response to the repairs. In emails back and forth they basically say no no no to all the repairs except the outlets. I found a housesitting gig that started in December and put in my notice. When I tell them I expect my whole deposit back because I'm moving due to the habitability issues they get back to me saying the roof will suddenly be fixed. They come out the week before we move out and fix the roof, but none of the mold. This interruption basically made it impossible to pack our huge home with. Then we all get the stomach flu and between the two we spend an extra week moving out. 

I just got the notice that outside my $1900 deposit they want me to pay another $500 in repairs. I'm taking this to small claims but have no idea how much to sue for. Just the $1900 doesn't seem to account for all the times we were paying for things we didn't get while living in a dangerous home. Small claims maxes out at 10k and I'm wondering if I ask for that if I have a leg to stand on. I have years of emails, pictures and videos from when we moved out, letters from the owners about not knowing the house needed so much work. I feel like our home was never habitable since there wasn't a support beam under one room, and they illegally rented to me for over 3 years. What should I do?"
legaladvice,Dog breeder dispute for terminally ill puppy purchased in Utah,"We live in the greater Seattle area but after quite a bit of research we purchased a Great Dane puppy from an ""experienced"" breeder who lives outside of Salt Lake City. My wife found her on Facebook and she had decent reviews. I flew to SLC to pick up the dog and pay the remainder of the cost after putting down a $300 deposit. All in, we paid $1450 for the dog. We took the dog to our vet the following weekend and found out he had a significant and obvious heart murmur despite receiving a certification of health and guarantee of such from the breeder and their vet. A cardiologist visit disclosed he has a congenital defect in both his tricuspid and mitral valves. Grown dogs that acquire this condition live no more than 12 months after onset. Puppies live for much less, usually only 3-6 months with full medical treatment. We give him 3 medications twice daily, mainly to prolong the inevitable and help his breathing.

The breeder was notified as soon as we heard he had a murmur from our local vet. At this point she disclosed that ""the other breeder"" said the mother dog was healthy. This was the first time we were made aware she had partnered with another breeder for this litter. Her Facebook posts announcing this litter and for each of the puppies did not mention that she was partnering with someone else. When I called her out for this, she said it was made very clear in all of the posts. We reviewed the Facebook post history which revealed she changed the posts to reflect the mother was from a different breeder *after* we called her out. We took screenshots of everything. We also have saved the text messages which show multiple inconsistencies and if one was willing, could be used as evidence of her deceit and potential fraud. 

The ""contract"" we signed is full of holes. We didn't even receive the fully completed contract from her until after we entered into the dispute. When I picked up the dog, she didn't fill it out. She had two blank copies. I filled out my portion and we both signed both copies. Only after I began to dispute it did she fill it out and send me her completed copy (which conveniently doesn't contain her name or address). The AKC papers only showed up afterwards as well when I called it out in the contract that she was to deliver them with the puppy. In our conversations during purchase she said the dog would be microchipped, however, that isn't in the contract. Not to anyone's surprise, the dog wasn't chipped despite it being part of the agreement we had in text messaging negotiation. 

The ultimate outcome per the contract if we have a dispute is that we are to return the dog to the breeder and be given a ""replacement"" puppy from a future litter. They make it clear no money is to be returned from the breeder. I asked that she pay back the full price of the dog and that we would eat the vet bills which are now ~$2000. She said she would return half of our money only if we returned the dog to her since the contract requires the dog be returned, the same contract that makes it clear she won't pay back any money, so... which is it? Are we going to follow only select pieces of the broken contract, or 100% of it? We provided her (as per the contract) the discharge paperwork with diagnoses and findings from both the primary vet and cardiologist along with itemized invoices. She also wanted the veterinarian and cardiology notes so I told her to contact them and retrieve them herself if it would help her come the the appropriate outcome.

We immediately made a connection with this puppy and refuse to pay to ship a terminally ill dog back to Utah to either die in transit or be coldly euthanized as part of a business transaction. She told us that the other breeder wasn't willing to pay anything and that she was being pressured to not give up her half of the payment we made. I still don't know the name of the other breeder nor have we seen any documentation regarding their dog.

Even if we were to pay hundreds of dollars to ship the dog, just to get a little bit of money back and a replacement dog, I wouldn't dare trust that that replacement puppy's parents would be healthy. The cardiologist was very clear with us that both parents should never be used to breed again. I made that clear to the breeder, but she refuses to believe that her dog was the one with the bad trait and the other breeder could care less since that's their income. 

We have not posted any public reviews yet or posted anything in her Facebook group for families of those who she has sold to. I reached out to a couple lawyers here in the Seattle area with no response. I know Utah does not have an animal lemon law, but due to her deception with the purchase and not fulfilling all the terms of the weak ass contract we have, would I have a case against her for fraud? 

tl;dr: we purchased a certified healthy puppy from out of state and found it has a easily identifiable, terminal heart condition. The breeder was deceptive and refuses to refund the full price."
legaladvice,Our Domestic Violence Case,"9 months ago my husband and I got into a fight. We went to a concert and we both drank way too much.

He drove away and I called the police. Our 18 year old son and I gave them a statement, both stating my husband had hit me in the face because my nose was bleeding. I know everything was exaggerated due to a heavy amount of drinking. My husband and I are still together, this had never happened before and hasn’t happened since.

legaladvice,What State am I a Legal Resident of?,"Hi everyone. Thanks for reading this. I'm currently doing service with my church in North Carolina in my church's service program which is similar to the Peace Corps or Jesuit Volunteer Corps. I lived in Virginia from when I was 11 to when I was 25 and left to go on what was supposed to be one year of service. The plan was for me to return home but then I decided to do a second year. You can do up to two years. In between your first and second year, you're given a month off to travel, visit family, take care of things at home, whatever. Our program runs from August-July. I am planning to apply to graduate school and live at home with my parents, maybe even work for the family business or go back to my old job until I can find better, salaried position. I am mostly applying to private, online schools to do graduate level academic work in fields like theology or social work but I want to keep my options open in case one of the state schools near me has an affordable program that I can take advantage of.

 When we're doing our year of service, all of the volunteers usually keep our state driver's license and vote absentee. Most usually return to the states that they come from, stay in the states that they serve in, or join religious orders after finishing. Again, I'm planning on returning to Virginia. I kept my Virginia license and voted absentee for two years. For tax purposes, we're considered ""independent contractors"" because of the way that stipends and benefits are handled. So, technically I will have been earning money in North Carolina, the place where I'm doing community service. But I never changed my license or voter registration. I know that, with Peace Corps Volunteers or Americorps Volunteers, they are usually treated as residents of the states that they left when it comes to establishing domicile for tax or school related purposes. If they return to their home state, they get in-state tuition. I just need to know which states to file taxes in and if I'm eligible for in-state tuition at state schools. Last year I filed taxes in two states because I lived in North Carolina for four months out of 2018, but was in Virginia making money for the other 8 months. Any clarification on legal domicile for taxes and tuition purposes would be awesome."
legaladvice,"SO received a notice of overpayment of medical assistance benefits that he never used dated from 7/19-1/20, but we received a notice in the mail 3 months prior stating that he was denied MA due to failing to provide income verification. (PA, US)","SO applied for Medical Assistance (MA) in Feb 2019 in Northumberland County, PA, US. We received a letter in the mail stating that he was approved, then a few weeks later received another letter stating that he was denied his claim for MA due to failing to provide requested documents (Income verification). In the meantime, we never had a letter or notice on PA Compass requesting income verification. At the time, we had a lot going on, and we did not fight it or resubmit the claim with the documents.

In October 2019, my SO got a letter in the mail from the assistance office that stated members are eligible for certain benefits and listed him as a member receiving MA. He emailed the Assistance Office and told them about the letter he had received and that he had been under the impression that he did not have medical assistance due to failing to provide income verification.

The assistance office replied stating that their records show that he has active benefits starting in April 2019.

This month, my SO got a phone call telling him that he was being investigated for fraud against the assistance office for failing to report a change in income, and to expect a letter in the mail if they choose to pursue the issue.

We received the letter today showing that the assistance office made an overpayment of nearly $3,000 for his medical assistance from July 2019 and going to January 2020. It states that he either has to pay back this full amount, file a dispute, or state that he can't afford to pay it and they may reduce the amount he must pay back.

They calculated his income at ~$300 above their income limit to receive medical assistance. No one was trying to defraud anything, as we didn't even know that he had medical assistance until he reached out 3 months after his benefits supposedly began, and 6 months after he had applied and been approved and then immediately denied due to failure to provide proof of income.

He never even used the benefits.

What can we do? This is incredibly stressful.

legaladvice,Need help with my hosuing situation.,"I live in a apartment complex in Seattle, WA. My upstairs neighbor had a kitchen accident which set off the sprinkler system. My apartment was drained by water when I got back home. My apartment complex assured  me of reimbursing the hotel costs initally if renters insurance did not pay. Initially they gave me an estimate of 3 days to fix my apartment, But that dragged onto 12 days with no communication coming from the apartment complex. My renter's insurance told me they would cover only up to $2k worth of temporary housing expenses.  I was way above that limit in first 10 days. We have been asking for help from the apartment complex since we paid rent for the month and the apartment is not in habitable condition. The apartment complex later told us that it would take another 10 days to redo kitchen. My apartment complex finally agreed to pay for hotel upto 115$ . However, The office manager could not find a hotel in that budget that has kitchen and w/d in my area and denied reimbursement of any food costs if they provide me with a hotel room that doesn't have kitchen. I have demanded for a hotel room that has kitchen unit so I don't incur more food costs. They have denied more money towards temporary housing and are currently offering only 115$ towards hotel costs.  I am currently paying for my own hotel and food bills. 

Since, this has not been my fault whatsoever. I wanted to know who is liable for all the costs? Is it my insurance company for limiting temp housing expenses to $2k or the housing complex which took the rent but did not provide any habitable condition or my upstairs neighbor who had that accident. 

Also,  do I need to claim it on my renter's insurance if it is not my fault ? 

All the repairs in my apartment are being done by my upstairs.neighbors insurance. 

I am particularly pissed with the apartment complex for giving timelines for repairs and the repairs dragging for longer. They have not communicated whether the apartment is fixed or not. Everytime I checkout from the hotel and come home and see that the repairs are still going on."
legaladvice,Stuck inside elevator in my apartment (OH) after leaning against the side. Firefighters broke door while trying to pry it open. Can landlord charge for damage?,"So as the title says, my friend and I were in the elevator and leaned up against the side at the same time (not aggressively but hard enough to be an issue I guess) and heard a noise. Basically the door came off the track and we were stuck. We called the phone in the elevator and they sent out the fire dept. When they came out, you could clearly hear the door breaking and cracking sounds. My father works for an elevator company and deals with issues like this all of the time. He’s now saying that because it was our fault, the elevator mechanics will likely say that it was from some type of abuse (jumping, rough  movement) and the landlord could ask us to pay. Now that the door is damaged from the fire dept, it could be as much as $10,000 to fix. Could they request we pay this amount? We didn’t request for the fire dept to come or break the doors? It apparently would have been a simple fix if they had sent an elevator mechanic at first."

Is this legal (Washington State)","(I might have used the wrong flair) I don’t work at the place I am asking about anymore. However, my roommate and a couple friends still do and we’re all very concerned about the new cash procedures. 

They just got a designated cash handler who counts the till in, and the next day counts all the till drops. I personally don’t legally understand how you can hand a mystery amount of cash to an employee that is SAID to be $250, but at no point can the the employee verify that. This seems shady? 

For some background info, I have never had till discrepancies like I did until I worked here. It was usually $10-20$ and eventually I was written up so many times that I was fired. I didn’t steal this cash, and I have a very hard time believing I was handing it back so wrong so often when I’ve literally never had this problem (10+ years handling cash). At the time, we were counting our own tills and supervised while doing so. I was able to verify that I was short. I always suspected that my manager on shift was taking this money from my till, but didn’t say anything. He’s also currently the new cash handler, that will be solely responsible for the safe and balancing tills.

Can my friends be held accountable for till shortages if they were never allowed to verify the contents? 

Thank you!"
legaladvice,[Philadelphia] How is charging the beverage tax on powdered mixes not a double tax if water in Philadelphia is a tax and not a utility?,"In Philadelphia county, water services are considered a tax and NOT a utility. The water board has stressed this vehemently, mostly as a way to avoid lawsuits that utilize the regulations put on utilities (especially USTRA, which says a tenant cannot be legally required to pay back payments on a utility gone unpaid by a landlord in order to have it turned back on in their own name.)  


Also in Philadelphia, they have a sweetened beverage tax. Any beverage that contains sugar OR an artificial sweetener is taxed at a rate of 1.5 cents per ounce.  


This tax extends to powdered/liquid beverage mixes that one buys and adds water to at home in order to make the beverage, and the tax is based on how many ounces it will ultimately make when prepared. So if you buy a $2.00 Crystal Light drink mix that makes 12 quarts when combined with water, you pay a beverage tax of $5.76 on top of your $2.00.  


So my question is - is this not double taxing? If paying for the water itself is a tax, and then you are paying tax based on a product that is 99% water you provided yourself?  


Just trying to figure out how they can get away with that, other than a general ""they're the government and they can do whatever they want"" response."

He’s always given me a creepy vibe (like tried to offer me a cash envelope, always tells me I’m beautiful and that he loves me like a sister) but I’ve done my best to brush it off because I otherwise love my job. He’s married with a daughter and I’m close to their family as well. Anyway, yesterday he asked me to go downstairs for a coffee. It’s not out of the norm, but I always dread being alone with him, because it creeps me out. So once we get into the elevator he leans in and kisses my cheek. I was visibly thrown off, but just kind of laughed awkwardly and changed the subject. We got our coffee, and I was dreading going back in the elevator because I felt like he was going to do it again. This time, he leans in and tries to kiss my mouth. I immediately retreated and said no and he stopped. I was in shock. I was shaking. He asked me into his office and he started saying how he meant it as a joke, and that he was sorry. I told him how uncomfortable it made me and made it clear that it was not welcomed or appropriate. Today, I emailed him saying I was working from home. So far, he has called me 7 times, emailed me a GIF of flowers, told me not to ‘overthink’ what happened, and that it is the intention not the action that mattered, and his intention was ‘just a joke’. He keeps trying to downplay what happened, but I told him it didn’t change how I felt. I have absolutely zero feelings towards him, other than disgust. I really don’t know what to do because not only is it a small/ intimate company, he’s the president. Our HR consultant works remotely and reports to him so I don’t feel like I can go to her. I love my job, but it’s no longer worth the constant discomfort and fear I feel at work. I know he will not want me leaving the company, let alone for this reason, and will worry about what I could say about him. I also feel trapped by the fact that he is my only reference for future work (this is my first job out of college). If anyone has any advice on what I should, or shouldn’t, do I would appreciate it so much. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: I have been sexually harassed by my boss and have no one to turn to. I am going to have to quit my (otherwise great) job because of it. Looking for advice."

Just have some questions regarding the process of applying for a divorce as a sole-applicant:

- how should partner be approached when coming to them with a DSA? 
- What are the processes for a DSA? (who to talk to, what paper work is needed etc.)
- is a DSA more expensive than a regular divorce?

legaladvice,"Showing of good cause denied, Civil court.","I'm currently being sued by one of the big banks for some(alleged) unpaid credit card debit. The case started on 04/2018.

legaladvice,Can I call my manager out for not letting me correct people about my gender?,"((Edit: Location is California))
I'm transgender and I don't look perfectly masculine so some people still call me she and her. Naturally I got into the habit of correcting people. Recently my manager (not boss but higher up) told me I made a guest uncomfortable because I corrected them and they felt bad. They told me not to correct people and I kinda just accepted it. But the more I think about it the angrier I got. Can he make me not correct people? I work at a Petco for reference. I feel like I should have the right to correct people on my gender identity. Its important to me and being called ""she"" makes me extremely uncomfortable and gross. Do I have the right to argue this? I'm at work so in 5 hours as of posting I'll answer any questions in the comments. Thanks!"
legaladvice,Can I get fired over a job that’s not in my contract? MD,"So my boss does this thing where if I get good at something he piles more jobs on me without a raise. His excuse is always “it won’t be that much,” but it always is that much. Most recently he’s added a task that takes up 50% of my time, and it turns out i’m pretty unqualified. It’s gotten to the point that it’s affecting my success in other parts of my job. 

My question is, if I go to him and tell him I don’t want to do this task anymore can he fire me for it? It’s not listed in my responsibilities on my contract. Maryland is also an at will state, which makes me think he can."

legaladvice,"DFW, TX 2 Part Advice needed: Buyout agreement for co-owned home (involving TPO/Family violence charges) AND posting warnings on social media","I have been in absolute ruin and distraught for over 2 months now following the aftermath of my abusive ex (of 4 years) dumping me 11/2/19, physically assaulting me on camera in our driveway, forcing me out of house and into a buyout agreement, and continuing to abuse me through financial and social means, as well as taking legal action against me employing falsehoods and misrepresentations of fact....

For my first question, I want to know what all can be done regarding my buyout agreement and this tpo/case he has filed against me.  I have sought a civil attorney in order to file suit against my ex for violating the legally binding, signed and notarized contract I was threatened and pressured into (taking a loss where some terms are set). The largest part of the contract I am concerned with is the exchange of monies I invested for ownership of my rights to the use and possession of the house. A monthly payment of $750 is to be made to me on the 22nd of each month via (preferred) Zelle pay, by check, or money order. However, on 1/10/20, my ex wrongfully filed a family violence civil case against me, stating that I was still stalking/contacting him and he was in fear of his life, requesting a protective order being put in place. I have secured an attorney to fight this as well... This case would label me an abuser and force me to take a batterer's counseling program based on lies I have evidence to the contrary of... My ex is now using this paperwork (and has contacted me after filing it, to which I am fearful and in a state of duress that he is doing so) in order to excuse himself from paying me what I'm owed, and I am reaching a state of full financial ruin--especially with the burden of having to hire 3 attorneys to handle various cases against him. Is there anything I can do other than continue with my civil suit against him to get my payments and fight this bogus case he has claimed against me?

For my second question, I have been told that he is seeking sexual relationships with strangers on a social media platform we both are on. I do not wish to interact with him (and will not do so), but I wanted to know if it was legal for me to post warnings on pages in which I know he is lurking for prey to warn these women about him? Not sharing anything personally identifying, just notifying them I'd be willing to share documentation of his violence and abuse to keep them away and safe from him. It causes me great terror thinking of another woman being subjected to his lies and manipulation, and there being a possibility they could be abused or attacked as well... in my own home he has stolen from me... And I especially don't want anything tied to me (such as assault, rape, etc) that he may commit against these women, since my name is still on the title, mortgage loan, and ac loan--that one is solely under me... He is already refusing to make other payments too and destroying my credit and slandering me to everyone where I used to live with him. I know he is slandering me but cannot search for evidence or prove it for fear of being further retaliated against..."
legaladvice,Anyone familiar with CA unemployment laws?,"Here is the background:

I am an associate optometrist in CA. I had been working part-time as a W2 employee with a per diem rate for an optometrist in her practice, and have been there 1 year.

I got pregnant and gave birth in Sept. My boss was nice and told me to take as much time off as I needed, but the end of my leave is approaching. I had my schedule for February and was ready to get back to work.

During my leave, i interviewed and accepted another job. My new (huge, corporate) employer requires about 3,000 hoops to jump through, including a thorough background check. It also takes a very long time to get credentialed for insurances in my profession, so when I accepted the position my start date was made for the end of March.

Because of the background check, my new employer told me they would be contacting my current job to verify my employment. Therefore i had to let my boss know that I was giving her notice, and would be able to continue to work for her and start in February as planned until the end of March.

She just contacted me to tell me she would rather i just not come back in for work, since I’ll be leaving anyway. 

This puts me in a bad spot— I have hired a nanny for my return to work for her, and by not going in for the days planned until March I will be losing out on about $6k worth of income.

Does anyone know if I might qualify for CA unemployment in this case? I think she’s being petty, but is she legally in the right in CA? It’s sticky since i’m unofficially on FMLA (didn’t fill our paperwork). Also, i gave her the 2 months notice verbally, while she fired me through a text a few days later.

legaladvice,[NYC] Landlord is Trying to Evict Us 2 Months into a 12 Month Lease. They do not have a COO for our apartment and are scared to get fined by DOB. Please Advise!,"QUEENS- My fiance and I moved into an apartment in Queens December 1. **We live on the first floor of a three floor building that used to be a single family home.** We found the apartment through a real estate broker and signed a one-year lease in late October.

On November 26, five days before we were supposed to move in, I got a frantic call from the landlord. She was saying that she no longer wanted us to move in because **they didn’t have a certificate of occupancy for the apartment**. We had nowhere else to go (not to mention we’d sold furniture and already paid them rent, security, plus the broker’s fee). I called the broker who explained the situation better than the distressed landlord.

Years ago, in order to rent the first floor as an air bnb, the landlords **removed the staircase connecting the first and second floor and added in a kitchen**, leaving only one exit staircase for the top two floors. Recently, the Housing Association the home is a part of discovered they were **illegally using the first floor as an air bnb and they were charged a very large fine**. They decided to rent the first floor out to tenants, hired a real estate broker, and signed a lease with us. Unfortunately, **they did this without procuring a COO from the Buildings Department.**

The real estate broker told us that if the Buildings Department comes by to inspect the apartment while we are living there, they may require they put the staircase back in, so that there are two legal exits to upstairs again. We agreed that if that happened, we would deal with it then and we were told the construction would take only a few days.

We moved in and we are quite happy here. Unfortunately, two days ago I started getting very distressed calls from the landlord again. She says that the Buildings Department called her to schedule an appointment to do an inspection on her building. She put them off, saying she was  out of the country (true that she is away), but that **she wants to do construction immediately to a) put in the staircase and b) take out the first floor kitchen, so it looks like a single family home when the inspector arrives.**

This is the first we are hearing of potentially removing the kitchen. **At first, she asked if we would move out**. Then when we were upset and said no, she claimed that after the inspection, they will put the kitchen back, and a privacy door on the staircase, and we can continue living here.

On the phone last night, **she said we could move in with her and her husband upstairs during the construction/inspection/re-construction**. She proposed that we occupy the third floor for free and share the kitchen with them. We are in our mid-thirties and do not want to live with strangers, so we refused. Then, she said that her and her husband could move out, and we could live in the top two floors alone while all of this is happening.

We both work from home, one of us with very expensive and difficult to move equipment, so this is challenging.

Also, what she is describing is illegal.

We want to be cooperative and we want to do what we can to stay in the home, however, I am concerned over a few things.

1. We have no idea or timeline when the construction will begin and end (she said, ""maybe a month""
2. We do not know how much room the staircase will cut out of the first floor

The landlord’s husband is coming to talk to us today at 2pm est. We have decided we will not agree to anything and need to get some things in writing, but we don’t have a lawyer (yet?). My questions:

1. As tenants, **what rights do we have to stay here until evicted by the buildings department for not having a COO?** There is nothing in the lease about them being able to evict us prior to the lease end date of Nov 30, 2020. The lease says any amendments to the lease must be agreed upon by both parties.
2. Do we have any claim to live on the top two floors, even though the lease says “first floor”, for the duration of the lease, should the Buildings Department evict us?
3. Why would the Buildings Department care about the kitchen? I thought this was about the exits? It seems like the landlord is spiraling. She is very difficult to deal with.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. **It’s my understanding that as tenants in NYC, we have the legal rent to withhold until there is a valid COO. However, to get a valid COO, they need to do this construction.** I am at a loss as to how to best protect our rights and live here in the most minimally invasive way possible during the construction. Not to mention the fact that, to do construction, you need permits. That take a long time to get approved.

My fiance thinks we should **stop paying rent, get a lawyer, and see what happens with the DOB.** He thinks they should pay the fine and do the construction if they are forced to, that we can’t get evicted because THEY’RE the ones without the exit, not us, and that we have a lease and tenant rights back the lease up.

I do not want to cause them to get a fine if they will inevitably have to do construction anyways."
legaladvice,Doctor performing test that were declined.,"I worked for an optometry office until recently. I left due to several shady practices, but one specifically struck me as possibly illegal. 

We offered retinal photography at check in. It is an additional charge that most inaurances do not cover. Patients would sign a document either consenting to or denying the test. The management discovered Medicaid would cover the retinal photo yearly. The Medicaid patients were still offered the test at our going rate, and often declined. I was instruced to perform the retinal photo regardless of the medicaid patient declining or not, so we could file for the payment.

Essentially, we filed, with insurance, a retinal photo on nearly every Medicaid patient. The patients were offered a chance to pay for a photo, but received it regardless. I am not sure how the law works, but it felt very scammy. I have friends that are still employed there, and I wonder if they are being coerced into breaking the law.

legaladvice,Tennessee Rental Deposit Return,"I have a problem. My partner &amp; I moved out of our apartment in June 2019. We lived there for a year without ever being late on our rent. When we moved out we forgot about the rental deposit return because we had a lot going on at the time with the move, etc. 

Yesterday my partner &amp; I were talking &amp; the deposit return came up. She called the apartment manager &amp; inquired about the deposit. After a lot I of searching, the apartment manager was able to locate a check they attempted to send us that had been returned to them. She said the check was expired &amp; that she couldn't give us the deposit back. After some polite questions, the manager said she would have to call her boss &amp; ask if she could send us a new check. The apartment manager never contracted us. Her boss did not contact us, either. 

So, is this legal? Can they keep our deposit because the check expired? Couldn't they just issue us another check? It's been less than a year since we moved out of the apartment. The apartment manager called me once after we moved out while I was working but didn't leave a voicemail so I thought nothing more about it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

legaladvice,My partner and their brother are the POA for their grandma but wants out because of fears that the brother has been taking advantage of grandma's finances. Is there away out of a POA in this situation?,"This is a throw away account and names are left out because we view this as being potentially serious and sorry for the length.

So back in November 2018 my partner's (P) grandpa started declining in health rapidly. He was in his late 80's (grandma is in her early eighties) and started having regular respiratory and pain problems especially after a couple falls in his home. After a hospitalization it was clear that someone other than grandma needed to be in charge of his care but there was an obstacle: this family is very dysfunctional plus grandma was beginning to show signs of dementia (she would later be officially diagnosed). None of their children were talking with each other and grandpa did not trust them to coordinate his care or facilitate end of life care. He did trust P and they reluctantly agreed to being the POA along with my partner’s brother (my brother-in-law). 

P and BIL had no idea how to navigate this, they were merely the most capable out of a family that barely functioned but they were trying their best. It was clear that grandpa needed some sort of assisted living and they didn’t want to separate grandpa and grandma. They found a home that could accommodate the level of care that grandpa needed and grandma would stay together in the same room. But we encountered the next problem: the grandparents had no money (had credit card debt and owed around 30K on a second mortgage) and they had very lousy insurance. To make things more complicated they also weren’t utilizing the benefits that they had and were essentially paying all medical expenses out of pocket (or credit cards). The home that we were moving them into had a policy that residents had to be cash pay for the first two years before they would accept Medicaid. P and BIL made it very clear to the manager of the home that they wouldn’t be able to be cash pay unless grandpas benefits kicked in (my partner had found VA benefits that would have covered his care and P began the application process prior to this point). The manager said that no residents have ever been kicked out for failing to be cash pay and that the home would work with them (this was not in writing). In early 2019 we moved grandparents in and sold the house (BIL actually bought the house to flip it and in retrospect was probably a bad idea). The money from the sale of the house went to paying off the second mortgage, credit card debt, and the rest was set aside to pay for care. The VA benefits, existing benefits, and social security was what was left to pay for their care.

Unfortunately, grandpa passed away fairly quickly after moving into the home and was not alive long enough for any of his benefits to kick in but he was there long enough to rack up about 14K in bills from the home related to his care which we had no way to pay for, grandpas life insurance barely covered his own funeral expenses. There was barely enough money to pay for grandmas care month to month and my partner and BIL were working with the manager to pay what they could on grandpas bill. Then comes fall 2019 and after a management change at the home they wanted the full amount of that 14K for grandpas care and they threatened eviction. P and BIL told them that grandma didn’t have the money and they were served the notice of eviction. The State social services became involved under the pretense that money was being stolen which would be elder abuse. A social worker came to interview grandma (either ignoring her dementia or not knowing about it) and grandma told them that she had no idea where her money went. This lead to local PD getting involved and P getting worried but my BIL became VERY worried. And my partner now suspects that BIL has been using the credit cards for his own use and not for grandma. At this point I suggested that we consult a lawyer but we do not have the ability to pay for one and have deemed it a last resort.

Since the eviction notice P and BIL had found a home that provides solid care for dementia patients and takes Medicaid. They started the application process and did everything that Medicaid asked for (provided financial records, cashed out grandmas life insurance to pay the outstanding debt to the home, ect) and this past week Medicaid talked to BIL and requested specific receipts and records ranging from the last 5 years. My BIL unilaterally made the decision that he would move grandma into his home saying that “it would be easier than jumping through Medicaid’s hoops”. This has made P suspect even more that BIL is hiding something and P has become very worried about their culpability in regards to BIL’s actions. She had planned on passing off the POA responsibilities to one of grandma’s kids after they moved her into a new home but now P wants to get out of the POA because they don’t want to be held responsible for what BIL does next or what he did do.

We are in between a rock and a hard place and feel very vulnerable at the moment. P definitely hasn’t taken any money and has done everything possible to reduce grandma’s costs and manage her care but we just don’t know what BIL has been up to. Any advice is appreciated."
legaladvice,My employee/coworker was just robbed. What should I do?,"I am a Shift Lead (M23) at a popular restaurant chain, my coworker (M17) was robbed tonight.

Some caveats that make this more complicated: We both smoke weed together regularly, including at work. I knew he had the ounce but not that it was at work today. I knew he planned on selling it (again, not at work though). There were two other cowrkers there that also know what happened, at least one is a huge gossip so the story will probably get out.

legaladvice,Tricky Rental Situation With Family. How Can I Remove Them?,"Thanks in advance for reading this. Any advice is appreciated.

So, my husband and I rented a home to his elderly maternal aunt and her husband about 10 years ago. Because she was poor and living off of Social Security, my mother-in-law negotiated a rental amount that was a little less than the mortgage and was covering the difference herself. We had a lease initially that has just continued on. 

At some point a few years ago, the aunts adult child, his wife and child showed up and began living there as well. No one asked us or informed us beforehand, but once we realized it, we allowed it to continue.

Since that time, mother-in-law passed away and made us promise to allow her sister to continue to live there until she too passed. The aunt was in her eighties and in poor health. We agreed and made us the difference ourselves. The aunt passed about six months ago, and we gave her husband notice that we planned to move back to our house and gave him six months notice to move. He asked if they could extend the move out date to allow the granddaughter to finish the school year. We reluctantly agreed and set the move out date for July 1st. 

January 1st comes and the uncle informs us that he is moving out that month. He is leaving behind the son and son’s family. The son is high functioning mentally disabled and his wife is unemployed. We doubt their ability to pay even the discounted rate. Because it is my husband’s cousin, and we had agreed to allow the child to finish the school year, we are willing to rent for six months to him, providing he signs a lease agreement and secures rental insurance. We mailed him a copy of a lease to sign and return along with contact information for our insurance agent who can provide discounted renters insurance. Since then, we haven’t heard anything back and no one in the family will return our calls.

Since he was never our tenant, but has established residency, I wonder what our obligations are. We have a 30 day notice from our tenant, but would we be required to provide an additional 30 day notice to the cousin after our tenant moves out? 

We don’t want to screw over the cousin because honestly, he doesn’t have anywhere to go and no financial means to support his family elsewhere. Currently they are living in a 3 bed room/2.5 bath house in a very desirable/upscale area for $900/month. This is well below market value, but we bought the house 25 years ago and they pay slightly less than the mortgage. We make up the difference and pay the HOA dues etc. We want to do right for him but also protect ourselves. We have been wanting to sell the home we live in out of state and move back to this house. We have been waiting and putting our plans on hold because of the promise my husband made to his mother about giving the aunt a place to live.

Sorry for the long post but any advice on how to untangle this is greatly appreciated.

The house is located near Richmond, Virginia."

legaladvice,Duck tales: Business contract &amp; family drama. Any way out of this without losing pants?,"Tl;dr - Four brothers, one business. One brother goes rogue after another passes. Does Huey's family have any wiggle room in the contract he signed?

&amp;#x200B;

Long, long ago, in a state far away (Virginia), four brothers signed a business contract - an LLC operating agreement for a large apartment property business. We'll call them Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Screwy. The brothers trusted each other completely and the business was run without a hitch for decades without any issues.

Fast forward to recent times and Huey has a heart attack. Screwy's family begins looking at the old Operating agreement because they're concerned about what happens if one of the brothers passes. To their surprise, the OA's are completely different than anyone thought or originally wanted. After all, the brothers trusted each other so much that they never thought it would matter. Everyone begins looking into the OA, but Huey's health quickly goes downhill.

The LLC OA says that upon a brother's death, the surviving brothers shall buy out the interest of the deceased. The valuation of the interest shall be based upon the last agreed value, as agreed by the partners, as set forth in the attached schedule. At lease annually, the price shall be determined by the brothers and recorded in the schedule. Unless the brothers agree otherwise, the last agreed value shall be used, even if it's over one year old.

Huey's family realizes that the agreed upon value is far below the actual market value. Huey's family even has a valuation performed. Screwy's family does the same with a certified appraisal. The valuation, the appraisal, and even the tax assessment, all show values significantly higher than the most recent ""agreed upon"" price in the contract, which was sadly baseless and last recorded by the brothers a few years ago. They were ""old school"" and, sadly, not concerned with these things at the time.

Here's where things get disgusting. Huey, whose condition is worsening, asks his family if there is anything he needs to have taken care of in case he passes. His family notes that everything is taken care of, except the property valuation which is outdated and far too low. Huey calls his brother Dewey, who then calls his brothers Louie and Screwy. They agree that the OA doesn't reflect their wishes, and they promise Huey, on his death bed, to honor his wishes and not go by the old OA. Given the small amount of time Huey has left, and wanting his last days to be peaceful, none of the brothers nor the families force the issue of changing or signing an amendment. After all, they trust one another fully and Screwy gave his word (something that has proven rock solid over their lifetimes).

Some time passes and Huey does as well, comfortable and surrounded by loved ones. Immediately after his passing, Screwy asks Dewey and Louie to meet with his attorney. He has directed his attorney that he wants the old OA ""upon death"" provisions to be carried out word for word, at the recorded (extremely low) value. It seems that Screwy's family is forcing the issue and Screwy, very old and heavily medicated, isn't in a position to deny them (of course there's more to this, but let's keep it simple).

Dewey, Louie, and Huey's family are all mortified. Screwy lied to them all on Huey's death bed and wants to carry out the old OA to acquire his portion of Huey's wife's 25% for the last ""agreed upon"" and incredibly low dart-throw value listed in the OA. Dewey and Louie try everything to convince Screwy to do otherwise. For many reasons, Screwy has changed. He's not the brother they remember and are mortified at his behavior, but Screwy will not budge. According to the letter of the contract, the three brothers are forced to buy out Huey's wife for var lower than actual value.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems to be a long shot, but is there any hope for Huey's family here? They're fully aware that Huey's complete trust in his brothers and their collective decision to not only sign a contract with provisions that they didn't understand (none of the 4 even realized this provision existed until recently), but to also not take the valuation section seriously, is what caused this issue. They fully understand their own responsibility in this mess.

With that said, assuming Screwy will not change his mind, is there any hope for Huey's family to receive a fair valuation for their forced sale of the business? Note that Dewey and Louie are on Huey's family's side but their hands appear to be tied.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The contract did not provide a way for the valuation in the schedule to be updated/changed UNLESS all of the brothers agreed to do so. For example, if 3 brothers agreed to update the valuation and the 4th refused, the value could never be updated over the years. Does this, in any way, invalidate this section of the contract?
2. The brothers verbally agreed to using the actual valuations (not the OA amount) before Huey passed. Does this hold any weight at all?
3. The brothers clearly agree that the old values were incorrect. Screwy's own certified appraisal, which he had performed shortly before Huey's death, clearly states that the valuation is far higher than the value listed.

Is there any chance of Huey's family being able to argue against the highly inaccurate, outdated ""agreed upon"" value in the OA? Or are they stuck because Huey signed on the dotted line?

&amp;#x200B;

Huey's family realizes this is a long shot and any thoughts would be much appreciated!"
legaladvice,Can I report elder abuse post mortem? (Oregon),"My neighbor died a few months ago and I just learned about elder abuse laws that apply in the state.  The son of the neighbor never visited despite his deteriorating health, and is the sole heir. Is there any recourse for this neighbor who should have been receiving more care but was being neglected by the son? If I’m reading the law right, the son had a duty to ensure his father was receiving medical care whether the father wanted it or not, that not regularly checking in is akin to neglect, and not ensuring that the father was connected constitutes as psychological abuse.  Also the son bought a new car recently, and is staying in the house now so possibly financial abuse?  He’s the executor of the estate but it seems pretty quick to have a financial disbursement, unless he is stealing from the estate, which means he has probably been doing that since before his father died.

legaladvice,[CA] Consequences for False CPS Reports,"I am going to keep this as vague as possible. I initiated a CPS investigation into my ex for physical abuse of one of my children. The incident is being investigated by CPS and the police, and CPS has made multiple visits to the child's school as well as at least one unscheduled visit to my ex's home while the children were in his custody. I believe that the report will be substantiated.

My ex found out that it was me who made the initial report and he retaliated by making numerous false allegations regarding physical abuse, substance abuse, and neglect. I found this out during a court procedure. It’s been over a week and nobody has interviewed me about these allegations, though I suspect that CPS will be visiting me soon. Some of the things that he said are provably false.   

My questions:

1. Is the fact that the CPS social worker is making unannounced visits to my ex's home and indication of anything? (like they have reason to believe that the children are not safe)

2. Are there any penalties or repercussions for him making knowingly false claims against me? What are my options in this regard?

legaladvice,"Wrist is broken due to someone else's actions, how to proceed?","Originally posted on r/needadvice, was recommended I try this sub. On mobile and wouldn't let me crosspost.

Back story: 

I play for an adult indoor soccer league. Recreational, co-ed, low-level. This past week my team played against this other team that seem to have it out for me. I don't know why, I've never antagonized them or anything, I play a clean game, because to me, soccer is not a contact sport. I play because it's fun and I enjoy the game.

Despite this, this other team behaves like they've never even heard mention of the term ""sportsmanship"". They trash talk openly, on the field and from the bench. Trying to stomp with their cleats, throw their elbows into my gut, charging me from every direction, tackling from behind, and basically taking every opportunity to throw me to the ground.

They do these things to my team as well, but I get the brunt of it.

I've gotten rather used to this type of behavior from my time in this league, and to deal with it I ignore it, brush it off, or sub out and take myself off the field for a bit, otherwise things tend to escalate. I don't bother reacting unless I absolutely have to defend myself.

I'm there for soccer, not drama.

The ref is either oblivious, an idiot, a coward, or all of the above. In any matter he does nothing but make the sitution worse, because he does nothing. 

Earlier in the season, I was going to the net when not one, but two of them tackled me from behind. I fell badly and smacked my head on the ground, then immediately got my skull body slammed by them. That was the worst concussion of my life, and took nearly 2 months to recover from.

Now this past week, they are playing the same way as mentioned above, and it kept escalating the whole game. No discipline from the ref. And to be clear, it's the majority of the team behaving this way, both men and women. 

I had the ball, was moving slowly and getting ready to pass when one of their team came sprinting at me from behind, body checking me so hard I was thrown off my feet, and hit the ground hard. I threw my hand out to try and break the fall, and also broke my radius.

While I was on the ground blinded by pain, other team was complaining to the ref that time was wasting. Like wtf. This was the second half with like 2 min left, game's pretty much over anyway.

Personally, if my team behaved like that I would quit, though fortunately my team is made up of really good people.

Now, I'm in pain and have to go about my life with basically one hand for maybe 2 months because some asshole has the emotional stability of a toddler. I mean it's a co-ed rec league for christ sake! I would think the idea is to to have fun, get some exercise, and go to work the next day. Instead, I've had 2 hospital visits and missed two weeks of work because of this team alone!

I know I have to quit this league, it's just not worth it anymore. 

I'm just really tired and angry of the assholes basically bullying me. And being the bigger person doesn't work with these kinds of people. Now that my wrist is broken, to me it's reached a new level, and I'm really damn tired of watching these assholes get off scott free.

 It's also not just about me though, anybody who behaves in such a way is a danger to others. It's not right for anyone looking for a casual and fun time kicking a ball around to also have to worry about getting a broken bone because of someone else's reckless behaviour and poor decisions.

I don't know where to where to go from here. I have more ridiculous stories similar to this from playing in this trash bag of a league. I'm worried  that if I push for something to be done about this, that nothing, or next to nothing will be done, based off past experience. 

If you've read this far, thank you for hearing me out. If you have any advice or wisdom to share I am open to all of it, and would very much  appreciate it."
legaladvice,Pipes Froze B/C Condo Owner Blocked Furnace Vents,"TL;DR: I live in a condo and a majority owner turned off the furnace which heats our crawlspace. Our pipes froze and I would like to explore legal actions to resolve this issue.   


Hi Everyone,  
I am in a rather precarious position and am seeking some opinions regarding potential legal actions surrounding some recent events at the condominium complex that I live in.  


The Facts:  
\- I am an owner (new owner) of one suite at this condominium complex (second floor of building) and am a member of the condo board  
\- The condo complex is located in Alberta, Canada  
\- The condo complex is 'unique' in that the entire ground floor is owned by one owner, who we will call ""John""  
\- The ground floor unit, owned by John, has a natural gas furnace which heats his units as well as a common crawlspace overhanging a parking lot  
\- All other condo units contain baseboard heaters and wall air units; natural gas heating is much less expensive than electrical.  
\- Our condo unit is one such unit on the second floor which overhangs this parking lot  
\- The common crawlspace contains plumbing for our unit, as well as several other units on the second floor  
\- Years ago, before we purchased this unit, John decided that he no longer wanted to heat the crawlspace for the second floor tenants, so he blocked off the vents leading to the shared crawlspace. John demanded $1000 monthly as payment for heating the crawlspace; at the time, this was refused.  
\- Where we live in Alberta, the weather can reach -30C during the wintertime. Pipes can and will freeze.  
\- Last week, our shower drain froze due to lack of heat in the crawlspace.   
\- It is our understanding that John is a particularly difficult individual, and has been sued in the past (by our condo board) in order to receive condominium fees backpay which he had owed over the years.  


My Next Step:  
1. Start a dialogue with 'John'. Perhaps he can be reasoned with and will simply unblock the air vents.  
2. Determine a fair rate for the condo board to pay John monthly to heat the crawlspace  
3. Celebrate.

Questions:   
**1. What legal recourse can be pursued if John refuses to open up the furnace vents?** The crawlspace is a mutually shared asset, and as far as I can tell, John is actively putting our building in danger by allowing pipes to freeze. This can lead to other issues as the pipes are located directly overtop of a parking lot.   


It's also incredibly annoying. Our floor was 8C for all of last week, and our electricity bill just came in at $316 for the past month (for only two of us).   


**2. Are you aware of any similar cases? If so, can you please cite them?** I could not successfully 'Google' any situations similar to this.   


Thank you for your attentiveness :)"

However, today the people renovating the upstairs apartment were using epoxy without alerting my wife and I (who live directly below the apartment in question) and my wife started experience headaches and loss of vision sometime mid afternoon.  I pulled her outside with our dog and she started feeling better quickly.  Turns out, the air ventilation system is connected to every apartment in the building, meaning our landlord gassed out every tenant in the building to use epoxy on the one apartment getting renovated without proper ventilation.  If i wasnt home, my wife and dog could possibly have passed out but I’m familiar with symptoms of poor air quality so I got them out in time.

legaladvice,Car has been at the repair shop for 6 months,"**Edit: We're in Indiana.**

Hello,

Our car started overheating back in July. On the recommendation of my FIL the car was taken to a local repair shop that he uses all the time. They replaced the radiator about a month later and told us to come pick it up. We did and the problem persisted plus they forgot to attach the engine cover so we returned the vehicle. We were then told that it was the O2 sensor and that they'd order one. A few weeks pass and it's ready again so we pick it up. This time the check engine light is flashing, temperature is maxed, and the engine is riding rough/losing power. We take it back. We're told the O2 sensor was the wrong one and this is where it goes off the rails.

For the next few months the only communication we've had is through the FIL. He won't give us pricing or what needs doing or even what's been done. He always says ""they're waiting on a part and it'll be ready next week."" This has literally been going on for months. It's put a huge strain on my wife's and my life. We then, against the FIL's wishes, go to the mechanic. He give us the same type of runaround about waiting on parts, and that he needs a special mechanic that is snowed in in some other state. I ask for an invoice and he hasn't got one. I ask for a list of what he's done and he can't give me that. I tell him from then on out to call me for updates. He agrees, but never does. This was back in November at this point.

This morning the FIL tells my wife the car is ready and they both go to pick it up. She drives it off the property and the temp goes up, the check engine light flashes, and the car rides rough. It's as if NOTHING has actually been done to the car. The last part they were waiting on was the onboard computer which apparently came in finally this week. Go figure.

I'm not a mechanic, but I do know that a flashing check engine light is the real kind of bad. It's now been driven away from the repair shop twice with that issue persisting. This could lead to damage to the engine itself which will be a more expensive repair.

Do I have anything I can do? We haven't paid for anything, have had no real interaction or anything with the shop, and our car is STILL there with the same problems almost as if it's being held hostage. Neither the FIL or the shop can tell me what's owed or how much or even what's all been done and I have no idea what to do next. Legally can I do anything since we haven't paid any money to the shop? Are we at fault for just being stupid or is the FIL or the shop? I almost feel like the car isn't worth it at this point as it's just a 2007 Suzuki SX4 and not worth very much, but damn, it's OUR car. Sorry.

This particular shop has a history, according to Google Reviews, about taking parts, not actually repairing things etc, but the FIL used him exclusively for all of his other vehicles and has for like 40 years...

Any kind of advice or help would really be appreciated."
legaladvice,Husband was 1099 but his company “required” mandatory team building and office time.,"Hi. My husband worked for a sales company in AZ where he was technically a 1099 contractor. Doing a little bit of research it has been stated that a company cannot require a 1099 contractor to be on a specific schedule, let alone require bullshit mandatory team building every week. 

My question is that, in their employee contracts- there is a section where it mentions that “due to the nature of this business, meetings in an office setting may be regular occurrence and if you need to accommodate your schedule to talk to leadership.” Something like that. It doesn’t explicitly state that it’s required but it was called mandatory by all of the managers for the entirety of his time working there. He worked 60+ hours a week and they even made him turn his location services on while working! Managers were constantly able to check in on his whereabouts. Wtf?

legaladvice,"Almost a year after I graduated, my school sent me a letter saying I have more student loans to pay off.","I took the loans in CA. I live in NJ now. 

I always kept track of how much I borrowed in student loans, and the extra amount specified in the letter isn't in any of my records. My initial thought was that this is fraud, so I called the school but sure enough they confirmed that I owe the additional amount. I have no idea when I took the loan, and am in fact pretty sure I never took it. I don't remember ever borrowing from a separate entity.  It's strange to me that all my loans show up in FedLoan Servicing except for this one.

Is there something I can do to figure out when I took out these loans? The school didn't seem to know that when I called them. Is there any legal action I should take?

Maybe also worth mentioning: The letter told me to make an account using a ""Heartland Key"" but when I put the Heartland Key into their website, it always says it's an invalid key, so it's not letting me pay the loan even if I wanted to"
legaladvice,Mom violated felony probation,"My mom has been on state felony probation in ID for the past 13 years and has never had any problems until 1 year ago. She is the General manager of a businesses and one of the other managers was bringing payments with electronic signatures (e-Sig's) to my mom with fake signatures so he can get his bonus percentage of the payment, and my mom just doing her job and not knowing at all that the electronic signatures were falsified, ran the payments like she has been doing for years. Fast forward a few months and my moms business is in a federal court battle with the business who's money was stolen, is fully cooperating and they build the whole case with my moms help and tell her she is getting charged with felony grand theft and my mom so scared to fight it pleaded guilty to felony grand theft gets the best deal, only 4 months house arrest ( no ankle monitor needed) and 30 hrs community service.

legaladvice,I need my neighbors to keep quiet at nights,"Everyone I’ve ever met in Sweden agrees that there’s an unwritten law when it comes to making noise in your apartment complex. (Hell, something similar is probably written somewhere as well) .

On weekdays, you need to be quiet after 10 pm

On weekends, you need to be quiet after midnight.

Apparently my neighbors didn’t get the memo. These guys often fight, argue, scream, play loud music and party in the middle of the night making it impossible for us to sleep.

We’ve tried banging on the walls (the live on the other side of our bedroom) and they just bang back and shout angry stuff. We’ve tried calling the “noise complaint jour” multiple times but they’re not much of a help since they need to make an investigation which feels like it never goes anywhere.

I was thinking of calling my tenant and complain (which I probably still am going to do on Monday, they’re closed on the weekends) but I’ve found out through another neighbor that the entire complex hates them and has complained multiple times over several years.

But nothing has been done.

I’m thinking about leaving an anonymous note through their mailbox and ask them to keep quiet. Of course not in a threatening way.

So my question is, could this put me in a legal situation? Is this a mistake? What do you think I should do instead? 

I mean, I guess I can go over and talk with them but from what I’ve experienced, they seem very hostile and I’m honestly a bit afraid of my safety."
legaladvice,My girlfriend's parents are being mentally and verbally abusive and I want to help her leave them,"I live in New Hampshire and she lives in New Jersey. I am 17 (18 in June) and she is 16 (17 in March).

Title sums it up. I am very worried that they are going to do something to hurt her, as she is already abused. I have no issue with my parents so it shouldn't be a problem for me especially because I get out of high school in a few months. She is worried that she will be put in foster care or taken away if she says anything. I think it would be better for her to be emancipated so that she could live with me and stay away from her parents. Is this a good idea and is there anything else we should consider?"
legaladvice,"""No Conflicting Rates"" as part of independent contractor agreement?","I'm a tutor about to sign a contract to work as an independent contractor with a tutoring company, which we'll call Company A. I have a general policy that I do not sign non-competes, unless the tutoring company can guarantee me a certain amount of pay. While Company A's contract does not have a non-compete, it does say that I am not allowed to list a different rate on my tutor profile on any other tutoring company's website. The problem is, Company B pays me a much higher percentage of my tutoring rate (Ex. 50% of listed hourly rate) while Company A pays me a much lower percentage of my tutoring rate (Ex. 25% of listed hourly rate), such that listing $100/hr with Company B makes me the same amount as listing $200/hr with Company A.

The only reason why I would consider working for Company A is if I can list a higher hourly rate on Company A's website, which I believe attracts a higher-end clientele.

Is this ""no conflicting rates"" requirement considered a form of non-compete? I have worked for more than half a dozen tutoring companies before, and this is the first time I have every seen this restriction. Something about it just feels off, but I'm not sure how accepted this is in an independent contractor agreement, and whether I have any ground, realistically, to negotiate this term.

Please point me to another subreddit if you think this is the wrong place for my question.

Thank you!"

legaladvice,POA Question,"Pretty certain I know the answer to these questions, but here goes:  

As she is deep in dementia land, I currently serve as my Mom's POA for both health and financial matters.  I have done for the past four years.   She has also named me to serve as her executor after she passes. 

She is long estranged from one of my several siblings.  She updated her Will a decade ago to reflect that they have no relationship.  However, she did not update the beneficiary info on several of her investment accounts.

Two questions:

1) Which document prevails in this matter -- the Will or the beneficiary indications on the investment accounts?  (I presume the accounts). 

2)  As her POA, am I able to update the beneficiary lists on the investment accounts to match her Will?  (I presume the answer is ""no"")

legaladvice,Parental rights termination (WA state),"I reside with my 5 year old son in Washington State. My son's biological father has not attempted contact with him in 3 years. I am the custodial parent and have full rights, and his father (as per our current parenting plan) would have weekly supervised visitation IF he were to complete a drug/alcohol evaluation and follow through with the required recommendations. Again, however no effort has been made on his behalf for the past 3+ years. He does also have a history of drug/alcohol abuse and violent behavior that I can present evidence of. He has never paid child support. Would this qualify as grounds for revocation of all parental rights, and how would I go about doing this?

legaladvice,Can I record firing an employee?,"Specifics are lacking for obvious reasons. 

I (M) am a manager, working in an office for a large corporation. One of my employees (F), several years my junior, is a terrible employee. 

I mean, she's always late, regularly under-delivers, does her work poorly/sloppily, frequently disregards the dress code, and has alienated her coworkers with her poor manners and hostile demeanor. She has been given over a dozen written warnings in the 10 months she has worked here. As far as my peers and HR are concerned, these are all fair grounds for firing.

However, a little birdie told me that she has a history of making/threatening to make false accusations (harrassment, sexism) when confronted with any sort of reprimand. I'd like to record my firing conversation, to avoid recieving both the unearned title of ""workplace abuser"" and the perpetual stigma that accompanies it. I'm especially worried since I'm the one who has given her the majority of the warnings.

Canada is a one-party consent state, but I'm not up-to-speed on all the employer-specific stipulations surrounding audio recordings in the context of a private conversation. I know that it is illegal for me to record private conversations between myself and an employee without their knowledge IF I AM ACTING AS AN AGENT OF THE COMPANY. 

I can't find anything online though about management recording private conversations between them and employees if the intended use of the recording is strictly personal and unrelated to company matters (a harassment suit is personal, right?) so I came to you fine people for help.

Please tell me if this is legal, or if not, how do I make it legal? Thanks in advance, you lovely legals."

legaladvice,Name Change Usage Method -- CA,"Hello. I'm currently a minor in SoCal looking to eventually change my surname officially. Due to familial issues and just my own desire I no longer wish to use or keep my current surname.

My main question is about ""the usage method.""

legaladvice,"[21] Kansas, I was arrested, released, and given the weekend to decide how I proceed with possession. (First time offense)","First, throwaway for obvious reasons.

I was at my usual smoking spot yesterday, right beside the highway (beside an overpass) and I was just about to start smoking when outta nowhere I look up and see two cop cars. Apparently an alarm was going off at one of the neighbors houses (there were a couple on the backroads), AND the gate that connects the interstate and the gravel road I was on was open. The officers approach my car and ask me ""Sir, is there any particular reason you're out here?"" While he's doing that I have my fully loaded bong right in my lap, ready to go. He asks me to drop everything and step outta the car.

He arrests me for the time being, puts me in his car, reads my rights, and asks if he can search my car. I comply and say of course. They search my car and take away my illegal items. I basically admitted to having ""weed, and other paraphilia."" I also can't recall if he had a body cam, or any other audio recording devices. I was very compliant thro He then basically says that I can drive away from this whole scene, and I can decide to either give information on who my seller is, or we can take this to court.

Now I should mention I do not want to deal with all the legal fees and time spent in the courtroom, but at the same time, I know my dealer on a somewhat personal level. He has worked with me at my current workplace and has been to my house. I believe that he has no gang affiliation, but, I am still personally worried about my safety.

I called the officer earlier today about this but he didn't answer. I left a voicemail and stated that I'm fine with giving information He gave me his card, and wrote his own personal number on the back of it. I'll update if he calls back.

The long and short of things, I don't want to pay fees for court, lawyers, or serve any jail time. And I'm concerned with my safety as far as my dealer goes. I assume that either today or tomorrow he'll call me back and I guess we'll see what's goin on

(I was only given his card when I left the scene, nothing else.)

Edit: I'd rather give up information than anything else at this point. That was my first instinct. I'd love all helpful options and opinions."

legaladvice,Did Aaron’s rob me?,"So a month ago, I looked into getting a new TV through Aaron's Furniture Rentals. Once I found one I liked, I put a down payment on it of $127.00. It was a Friday at the time and they assured it would be delivered on the following Monday. They were insistent that they deliver it and I not take it home myself. When Monday came around I received a call from them and they cancelled the delivery due to lack of delivery drivers. I went to another furniture rental place in the meantime (Rent-a-Center) and found the same TV for cheaper, so naturally called Aaron's and cancelled my purchase. They told me i would receive a full refund for the TV and to this day, a month+ later, it still hasn't showed up. I've called them numerous times since and was told things like ""It's in the works"" or ""Corporate is handling it.""

2   Debts include things that occurred before her lengthy hospital stay  prior to passing that she was delinquent with as well as hospital, medical bills accrued leading up to her passing

legaladvice,[OR] Getting rid of a junk car with no title,"Hello, this is a bit complicated. I have a car that is registered to my father. He is indefinitely unreachable and even though it's registered to him, It's been my car for 17 years and he wouldn't want it. Registered in Oregon.

anyway, the car is junk, expired tags, and I desperately want to get rid of it. I have no title since my dad lost it when I was a teenager. DMV says there's a lien on the car and can't issue a new title (which in of itself is BS because I paid cash for it, but whatever). This car lot no longer exists, DMV phone number on file is disconnected. Junk yards won't take it without a title, or without my father present to sign it over with the registration.

If I push this car on the street, obviously it will get towed. However, how will this affect my father? He's in a program for his health and we're not on speaking terms. He already has nothing to his name and I don't want to set up a situation where he has a warrant on him, or obligated to pay fines that he'll never be able to pay.

I just want this car gone. DMV basically shrugged at me because I'm not the registered owner, and my father will not be able to deal with this problem.

[The law I've been able to find is here](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/819.150)

And it sounds like my  father would be held liable for towing and storage fees, but since I don't understand legalese, it sounds like maybe if he just ignores it the towing company will take ownership of the vehicle and my dad will not be on the hook for anything?

Thanks."

legaladvice,Estranged husband secretly entered and photographed the interior of my apartment (TX),"throwaway account.  

I’m a disabled (female) veteran who sought inpatient care for one week to address panic attacks and was discharged on Wednesday after successful medication change stopped my symptoms.  This hospitalization was completely voluntary, and I sought inpatient care during this time because I’ve had rare, terrible medication side effects in the past that affected my eyes and I didn’t want to put any stress on my children particularly when it comes to my vision.

I have my own apartment with cats.  In the past, I’ve paid for a neighbor to watch my cats.  This person is lovely, but is completely inept at taking care of cats, so I asked my estranged spouse (who I had decent rapport with over the last 1.5 years of separation) via text to stop by my apartment complex and send the kids upstairs to clean out my cat’s litter box every few days since I was hard-pressed for help.

He had never set foot in my home before this time even if he was invited, but during my absence he proceeded to not only enter my personal apartment uninvited, but spend 9 days meticulously deconstructing and photographing my entire personal life, opening every conceivable door (including FUSEBOXES ffs!), stealing my mail regarding my upcoming rental expiration, taking $2000 in cash (but returning $1700) that was within 1 inch of my dildo box in my nightstand, leaving my diary at a past page (I can only assume that extremely personal document was photographed as well), and going through my secured medication and locked firearms that were safely stored away.  He visited me in the hospital once to tell me he hired a lawyer for our divorce, though we agreed to do this amicably without lawyers.  During my hospitalization, he sent me a text with his ‘findings’, presumably to leave a paper trail.  This text included gems such as me having a concerningly bare fridge during my time without the kids while I was hospitalized for a prolonged amount of time because I gave away, dehydrated, or froze all my perishables and I meal prep so much of my food is in the freezer.  

I have NOTHING to hide!  He has a history of very controlling behavior towards me and his profoundly disabled mother, but I’ve never reported anything before due to concerns about my military security clearance.  He had a CPS case opened against him for child abuse when we began the divorce process, which I played the ‘loving wife’ part for and now severely regret.  Something in him is not right, and I’m not sure how to handle this.

My question is, has he violated any sort of law or is there any sort of action that I can take to keep him from continuing this behavior?  His behavior is escalating and I do not feel safe in my home, but I don’t have the resources to move.  

Thank you so very much for any advice you can share."

Seeing as I had been released, the same loved one decided to try the Marchman act this time around. This time, the psychiatrist evaluated me and determined that I was not a threat to myself, but determined that I should enroll in a 30 outpatient rehab program. However, since this is just a recommendation from a mental health professional and not a judge, the petitioner (my loved one) must file a Marchman Act part II, which is a petition to a magistrate in which the magistrate ordered me to go to the 30 day outpatient treatment. I completed the treatment, and the magistrate closed the case.

My question is whether the aforementioned events would impact my ability to acquire a firearm should I want one."

legaladvice,"Strongly need advice on visa process, marriage on tourist visa, and international job assignment","I a US citizen and I met someone from Azerbaijan who is on a tourist visa. We met shortly after she arrived in the US and have been together nearly 5 months. I know it's not a long time and might sound crazy, but she is the most wonderful person I've ever met and would happily spend the rest of my life with her (feelings are mutual). 

I've just received an opportunity in my job to do a short term international assignment in The Hague, Netherlands. This will likely be a very good opportunity for me, but I can't lose her. I've looked up Visa requirements for the Netherlands and it looks like you can only apply for a 3-month tourist Visa there and my short term assignment would likely be 6+ months. 

We've been considering taking the next step of marriage and with this new work assignment we may begin taking this option more seriously. But after doing some research, the fact that I might be leaving in US for half a year seems to complicate this. I read that once you are married to someone on a tourist visa they are not allowed to leave the US (until the status is approved?), therefore making her come with me to the Netherlands more difficult. 

Would anyone be able to provide some advice? I would be fine if we had to be apart for a period of time, but the last thing I want is to lose her, which I know is something I'd regret for the rest of my life.

Your honest advice is deeply appreciated."

At the start of 2020, my boss said we would have to do some training at home on the computer before March. Usually we do these at work but I didn't think much of it. When I checked there is almost 100 hours worth of training to do, by the website's own estimates.

legaladvice,Getting ghosted by my landlord,"Tldr: landlord not cooperating, ignoring any attempt to find out about receiving my security deposit back after moving out of a rental home.



So my situation is this… After moving out of a rental home, the landlord has ignored all of my inquiries about returning my security deposit.
 My Boyfriend and I were renting a house from an individual for a 1 year term, with a month to month lease at the conclusion of the year. We moved into the house in April of 2018 and moved out in September of 2019 after purchasing a new home. When we secured the rental, we DID sign a lease contract. I made sure to read over the contract and discuss its terms for clarity. It was, however, a rushed event and took place in the parking lot of the bank I used to withdraw money for our security deposit AND first month’s rent.


 
Because of the unorthodox way this was handled, I was not given a copy of my contract upon signing. I was promised a copy to be delivered in the near future. That never happened. I also did not press the matter. I have since requested a copy of the contract and have not gotten a response. To the best of my knowledge, we satisfied the terms of our contract and left the home spotless upon moving out. We gave a 30 day notice and rent was always paid on time.


 
While I do not have a copy of the contract, here’s what I do have:
 

I did get a statement with a signature saying the amount owed for deposit was paid.  I also made sure to pay with check each month thereafter, with the purpose of rent in the memo line.
 

I have a few pictures of the condition of the house, but none were taken upon being fully moved out.  They moved a new tenant in shortly after we vacated the premises.
 

I have every text interaction we’ve had, as well as all the ignored requests for response in regards to receiving our deposit back. I have my phone log as well showing the attempted calls, which have all been ignored.
 

Figuring I was blocked, I began to start calling from other numbers and I did get a hold of the landlord again. I reminded him of who I was and stated why I was trying to reach him. I was told that he wasn’t in the office since it was a Saturday, but to call back on Monday and we would get it worked out… so I called again on Monday, but from yet another phone number. I once again was assured that all I owed was a little for the last month’s electricity (which I paid a separate $150 deposit for, but I was willing to let that go) and the rest of the amount of $900 would be returned to me in the mail. I was told to send my address via text and he apologized for the run around.


I wanted to believe him, but I feared this was another distraction. I waited 10 days before I reached out again. I attempted another call from my own phone, not wanting to wear out my trick of calling from random numbers… I got no response. I sent another text message. Nothing.
 


I don’t know what my next step should be. I understand that $900 might not be worth it to pursue, but I am still in my twenties! I work 3 jobs and I just bought a house. It would be a lot of help for me.


All of this has taken place in Louisiana. I researched some of our laws regarding rentals, and to my understanding, the landlord was required to either repay my deposit or furnish a receipt of sorts as to what my deposit was used to pay for in repairs within 30 days of moving out. It also seems that I am not required to even have a copy of my lease, but that the landlord has to present it on demand.
 


I’ve never needed any legal help before, and I’m not sure that there is anything I can do about my situation. Sometimes the bad guys just get away with things. But regardless of the money aspect, I am now invested in making sure I do everything I can to insure he doesn’t get away with this. It’s not fair and I will not let this go! Is there any help anyone can offer about how to deal with this situation or what legal steps I can take to make him pay?!

legaladvice,My stepmom is not forthcoming with info,"My grandmother passed away March 2019. Her only child was my dad and he and his wife obtained her house. They were in the process of selling it (trying to find a realtor) when my dad passed away Dec 2019 from ALS. 

I am my dad’s only child. His wife is now left to handle everything. I am supposed to be entitled to half of the proceeds from my grandmas house and half of my dad’s 401k. 

My dad lived 15 hours away. When I last saw him a week before he died he was very sick and I just wanted to spend his last moments with him so we didn’t discuss anything financial. I didn’t see a will or anything. I’m just going off of what they told me. 

So now, my stepmom isn’t giving me any kind of information. Didn’t tell me when the house was put on the market. I had to find out from google. She didn’t tell me anything about his last moments, like how he actually died. She hasn’t said anything about the 401k until I asked and she said they were still waiting on the death certificate. From my understanding those only take 10 days and it’s been about 45 now. 

They have been only been together 10 years and married 6. If I was married into a family and left to take care of the affairs I would make sure to include the children! 

Should I consult with an attorney or is there not really anything I can do about it?

legaladvice,My employer says I can't use the restroom while doing a treatment which can be 3-8 hours long. They simply do not want to pay for another employee to be present/relief.,"In the medical field and sometimes I will have a treatment which can be up to 8 hours long. Most of the time it is entirely safe for the patient if I use the restroom especially if I have a nurse with them. One of my co-workers has used the restroom out of desperation, knowing it was against policy. To their shock, the boss just decided to check in and they got suspended. You can could get fired at this time for using the bathroom. 

I want to have a child but I am afraid of not being able to hold it for that long! I do not want to lose my job or mess myself at work. HR has been talked to and basically said that that is policy....

Is this legal? Honestly I think this is antiquated and it is being done under the radar to save cost for hiring bathroom relief. If I have to be the bad guy and Sue to get something done, it seems like a big pain, but I am not going to mess myself on the clock like an animal.

legaladvice,"Memphis, TN - Salary-exempt to Hourly Wages; Contact FLSA?","Hello, and thank you for reading this. I'm posting this on behalf of my boyfriend. 

He recently quit his job as a warehouse worker for a unique gift shop (head-shop) in Memphis, TN. While working there, he was moved to a salaried position right before one of the busiest times of the year (April 20th). In this time, he worked an event and did a few odd jobs for their social media but never officially held that title. After a little less than a year, he and a few other salary-exempt workers were moved to hourly wages. Initially, he was upset about being moved. He asked why he had been moved, and they expressed that it was not a demotion and that the workers affected never qualified for salary in the first place. 

My boyfriend quit because he is under the impression that he was taken advantage of, put in a salaried position, while there was a high chance that he would need to work overtime. Unfortunately, there is little documentation of any hours worked as a salary-exempt employee, as they did not require people to clock-in (which seemed very odd to us), but he can show he was doing things off the clock with the social media posts. 

We are curious to find out what the typical outcome is for those who go to the FLSA with similar issues. Is it worth contacting them at all?"

""Cancellation Rights (Buyer’s Rights)
As a buyer, you have the following rights under Rhode Island General

(2)Either your Local Gym Name or you relocate more than 15 miles from present location, or the services provided by Gym Name are materially impaired.""

Since I have relocated significantly more than 15 miles, does this mean I would not need to pay the cancellation fee?

legaladvice,[GA] How to know when it's time to find a different lawyer? (Domestic Relations - Paternity and Legitimation),"TLDR: My attorney messed up once already on a part of the case that was very important to me.  The next step has long lasting ramifications. How does one evaluate whether to stick with them or find someone else?

I can imagine people rush to 'fire their lawyer' when things don't go their way. People jump to conclusions, and commonly misdirect their ire towards their attorney. Less frequently, I imagine, the attorney just isn't a good fit, lacks the specialization, or simply fails to gain the confidence of the client.

Some context:

My attorney and I are not in lockstep in my case. The attorney knew that I wanted to wrap up the first part (paternity verification/DNA test) as soon as possible so I could start making plans to move cross country. I made it very clear that this question has been eating at me, and that the mother had evaded the topic anytime I brought it up.  Eventually cutting off contact completely. I live 1500 miles away. I'm currently between careers, having recently completed a masters degree, and time is of the essence. I'm planning to move, pending the positive verification of paternity.  Unfortunately, the mother has a history of dishonesty and manipulation, which I found out too late. 

So, prior to filing the case, I tried to warn the attorney that, based on my previous experience, if we give the defendant any opportunity to delay, the defendant will delay. Attorney was dismissive of my concern, ignored my warning, and as expected - the defendant continued to delay. The state statute is has a specific provision to prevent unnecessary delay, which I urged the attorney to utilize, but the attorney did not. When I pressed as to why not, I got some sort of ""because I'm right and that's that"" mentality. I'm paying good money to this attorney, and it feels like my life is their hands. 

There have been a couple other instances which gave me pause. Little things that alone wouldn't be a big deal, but taken together make me go ""hmmm?"".  

Baldface lie (bait and switch):

On the initial consult, the office's paralegal quoted the initial cost at $3k. When I called back two days later to provide payment, the same paralegal told me they would charge my card in the amount of $3,500. I had my notes from the previous call where I wrote down the fee estimate.  I said, ""oh, um, on Monday you told me it would be $3k."" And she snaps back, defensively ""no I didn't, I said between $3k and $3,500. I need $3,500 to proceed. Do you want to proceed?"" I don't like being lied to. 

Billing me for training time:

When looking over my first invoice I noticed a line item cost that appeared inconsistent. I diplomatically inquired, and the attorney quickly replied ""yeah it took a little longer than it should have to weave through \[x\] issue"" and provided a credit. 

Conflicting explanations:

In another instance, during a meeting we were discussing retroactive child support calculations. I asked if the court would apply retroactive support even though I had no legitimate claim to the child due to the mother's unwillingness to cooperate.  The attorney stated that she was ""unsure as to how it would apply in this case, and that the court has been evolving on that subject.""

A couple weeks later I received notification of an agreement that the attorney struck with the opposing counsel. That came in a forwarded email. In reading through the email string I see that the attorney is negotiating to bring them to the table by saying, ""...and if Mrs. Defendant has any documentation of any expenses, please send that to me so we can get Mr. Client paying on that right away."" 

I asked ""Why would we voluntarily be offering to be paying expenses retroactively when the mother was denying visitation. Seems like we're rewarding her for boxing me out."" Her response was curt with no further explanation, ""because it's the law."" Did the law change...did you uncover some new information? Maybe to explain that to me before offering that I'll pay? 

\----------

Step one of the case is finally nearing completion. That step was pretty straightforward, but the attorney's performance fell short of expectations.  The next step is much more complex, with long-lasting ramifications.  

As the title states, how do you know when it's time to find a different attorney?

legaladvice,"[Dallas, TX] My apartment has failed to fix many issues and will not give me copies of work orders that are not completed.","I've had a giant patch of mold above my shower since I moved in 6 months ago and they haven't fully fixed that issue.

They had to reschedule that wet spray treatment 4 times because the company never showed. When they did, we were told by the apartment AND the management of the pest company that both us and our dog could be in the apartment as long as the dog was in a separate room for the duration of the spray and 3-4 hours after. The pest guy came in, sprayed for 5 seconds in the bathroom and kitchen and went to leave. my BF said ""are you done? you can spray everything you need to."". and pest control said we had to be out of the house.

This is not the first or last thing that has caused issues. Among other things, they basically are stealing money from me. I used to always overpay by a few dollars on rent because i'd rather get a money order for $930 than $927.46.

legaladvice,My husband may be FALSELY accused of sexual assault,"I reposted from r/relationship_advice per one users suggestion.  I did briefly speak with our attorney who said to do nothing at the moment because they don’t want her to change her story- but I’d appreciate additional advice. 

So work has been hard for my husband lately, like really hard. He works an average of 16 hour days, 6 days a week and has done so for 2 years. He absolutely loved his job and he was SO dedicated to it. We met at work and that’s what made him love me, I was equally dedicated to my job. He fell in love with my work ethic first LOL. 

When I started at the company, I was a manager and I made friends with a field manager who he was close with. We would spend weekends having cookouts, going fishing, etc... 
There was an incident shortly after we got married where she made a pass at him when I wasn’t around. We made the decision that we would start to distance ourselves, but we were never unprofessional or rude. 

Shortly after all of that, he started having trouble with his bosses. He was accused of stealing, lying about what he does, and a slew of other things... and we couldn’t figure out what happened. So it’s been months of just verbal abuse from his management and we had NO idea what changed. 
She made the mistake of telling an employee what she was doing, and this employee is like a brother to us. He will literally be our child’s godfather, so of course he turns around and tells us that she’s trying to get people to turn him in to corporate for things that aren’t true. 

He tried to go to his management about it, but she caused enough drama and problems that they weren’t listening. They said it’s ironic that he’s in the spotlight, but now he’s painting her as a problem. 

Around this time, I decided to step down. I had just found out that I was pregnant and the stress was getting to be a bit much for me (It was actually doctor recommended because I went from having perfect blood pressure to super high blood pressure and I lost over 18lbs during my first trimester, NOT from morning sickness. Just stress.) 

I stayed quiet and listened and played along. My husband didn’t know at the time, but I had been collecting signed and notarized testimony from employees that she was a tyrant having a hissy fit, and I collected evidence that she was unprofessional and going way above and beyond her pay grade because she had the president and Vice President on her side, essentially protecting her. 

After a LONG conversation with the president, along with all of my evidence and the fact that I may have yelled at him, and I never yell, he finally understood that she is the problem employee. We got the green light to let her go and we did. 

Upon firing her, my husband went through her work phone to ensure she wasn’t selling any confidential information etc.. and this is standard practice. They went through mine when I stepped down lol. When we started going through it, we found messages between her and an corporate employee discussing their plans to get him fired. Okay, whatever. We’re pretty used to finding some smack talking in the messages, so it didn’t really matter. She then goes on to say she hopes I lose my child and that it’s going to be nothing but a degenerate deadbeat like it’s parents. Lol. The horrific part is where she stated that she will turn him in for sexual assault if they don’t fire him.. not harassment... ASSAULT. So now it’s not just a job issue, it’s a legal one. The problem is, the night she is saying that it happened, it is impossible. He was actually in corporate meetings with 5 other people, where when they got back to the hotel, they drank at the bar, and eventually had to help him back to his room because he’d had too much to drink. I was in the room, so he was literally accounted for that entire evening. I don’t like calling someone a liar when they claim something like that, but she’s a habitual liar who’s story makes no sense. She’s saying he did it in his hotel room. She doesn’t know I went on that trip too and that I was in his room with him. 

Now what? We don’t want to go to his management because we’re afraid they will start the “I’m tired of the drama” nonsense again and accuse him of trying to continue the drama after she’s gone. We’ve saved all of the messages as evidence if anything happens.. but now what? 

TLDR; A problem employee almost got my husband fired. After the truth came out, she got fired. She’s now claiming he sexually assaulted her to other employees and her story is literally impossible. We’re concerned about legal and professional repercussions. I want to go to her house and put her in her place but it’s unprofessional and I’m pregnant, so I really shouldn’t be doing anything stupid. Now what?"
legaladvice,They tied up our fire exit. Candidacy for Rent Witholding? [NYC Apartment],"Hey,  
So this is...clearly bad. We noticed that our emergency exit (at the top of our building) was broken, and swinging wide open. We contacted the management company/super to fix it and they eventually worked out this genius plan:

legaladvice,Security Deposit Dispute from Broken Lease and Bed Bugs,"I rent out my townhouse in northern Virginia while working overseas using a property management company. Did it for several years without issues. 

This fall, new tenants moved in. A month into the lease, and after having asked for some maintenance fixes related to move in, they said the house had bed bugs. We confirmed with the PM’s exterminator. The previous tenants had no problems with bugs nor was anything noted during move in inspection. 

The new tenants demanded I pay for the bug treatment. The bug guy and PM said given the circumstances, the tenants brought them in somehow (ie not an existing condition). I offered to split the cost, and they refused. After a few weeks, they asked to be let out of the lease. I offered to let them do that with only one month’s penalty from the deposit. They balked and called me  racist. (I have no idea what race they are. Ive never seen or met them.)

Eventually, they broke the lease and just moved out. Since then, I have paid to have the house treated, and am trying to find new renters. I have to decide what to do with their two months security deposit. What would be ethically/legally sustainable in these circumstances? I want to be fair, but also not get wrapped up in court. (They told the PM they would sue if they didn’t get full security deposit back.) I’m thinking one months rent for breaking the lease, plus the cost of the treatment. 

Thanks for helping me think through this. I’ve never dealt with anything like this before, and it’s been the first major issue since I became a landlord."

legaladvice,Parents selling their house. Realtor said something we dont know if it's true.,"My parents realtor in Houston said that when someone is interested in their house they will have an appraiser and inspector called to look at the house. But if the appraiser seems the house isnt worth what they are selling it at, my parents HAVE to lower the cost of the house to match the appraisal.  So for example if they are selling it at 300k and the appraisal says 250k they have to lower the price of the house down. Is it a law that makes this happen or just the opinion of the realtor?

Edit: 
It's possible they misunderstood the realtor. My sister used him to purchase a house and that's what she understood too. She had to appraise the house she was interested in and if it didnt match they would have to lower the cost of the house to match the appraisal."
legaladvice,Lost safe deposit box,"A relative of mine, Jane, was recently widowed and I'm trying to help sort out her financial affairs.  Jane is elderly and has memory problems. Jane claims she has had a safe deposit box for several decades.  She has a key for it that is labeled with a box number, but she cannot find any bank statements or other financial records that mention it.  She says it was originally part of her bank's promotional package deal with new accounts in which a safe deposit box was included with no additional charge, so there have never been any payments for it (nor records of payments for it). We went to Jane's bank and they say they do not have any record of her currently having a box.  A manager said they would conduct a more thorough investigation and then days later reported to us that they are confident that she does not have a safe deposit box with them.

The bank went through several mergers, acquisitions, changes of names, etc. over the decades that Jane has been banking with them.  I am speculating at this point that through these business reorganizations, the free safe deposit box deal expired (or was forgotten) and records of it are no longer accessible; and then the box was never paid for, and then it was considered abandoned.  I am also considering that Jane has simply misremembered which bank/branch the box is physically located in and has forgotten other locations where she may have banked over the years.

She is located in Pennsylvania as are all the potential bank branches involved.  I have checked the Pennsylvania Treasury's Unclaimed Property website but a search on her name there turns up nothing.  I don't know where to go from here.

My questions are:

1. If the box were considered abandoned, legally could the fate of its contents be anywhere other than turned over to the state government?
2. Would there be any other government record of it beyond the Pennsylvania Treasury's Unclaimed Property website?
3. If the box is still in existence and we just don't know where, is there any way of finding out where it is?
4. Would a lawyer be able to help, and if so what type of lawyer?  (The financial and sentimental value of the items in the box may be substantial, so we are willing to spend the money on a lawyer if it will help.)"
legaladvice,[MO] I got rear-ended. I don’t know what my next steps should be to prepare for worst case scenarios.,"On Thursday night I got rear-ended pretty hard while waiting for a stoplight. The other driver claims total fault, that her foot slipped onto the gas when she meant to brake. We traded insurance information. The damage to my car is just a tiny dent, it’s driving fine.

Immediately after I had been hit my back hurt just a little bit, but only to the level of like, sleeping on the wrong side of the bed. Yesterday it hurt only when I woke up. Today it doesn’t really hurt at all. I didn’t go to a doctor because if I was injured, it seemed minor

But I have a friend who got into an accident a few years back who walked away at the time with a few scratches, until it turned out a few months later that she had gotten a traumatic brain injury that she is still living with. 

I’m terrified that that sort of thing is going to happen to me, and that I’m going to wake up a week from now or something in debilitating pain.

Is this common? All I found when I googled it was attorney websites, which... Does not seem helpful. If I don’t see a doctor now (it’s been less than 48 hours), even if nothing seems wrong, will that help me in the worst-case scenario? If I do, and I start hurting down the line, will it help me? Should I suck it up and go to urgent care just to get the documentation? My co pay is pretty expensive...

Please help me out. I’ve never been in an accident before and I’ve got no idea what to do."

Office Admin is now lying and telling the General Manager that my mom never went to her for help and that my mom didn't fill out the forms in the office. There is proof as the office has cameras but management refuses to watch them.

Does she have the right to receive her services even though the owner of the counseling business is refusing an accepted form of insurance? For the last 8 months or so, they led her to believe that everything was fine with her insurance provider. Then all of the sudden, they tell her they've been having issues with getting payed out from her insurance for some time now and that they're fed up with it. There was no warning or communication from the time there difficulty started to the point of them to just being fed up with it. It was just, ""We can't provide you with services anymore."" This was after she already signed up for benefits again for 2020. So now she's stuck with what she has and can't switch insurance providers. She really wants to continue with who she'd been seeing because of the good chemistry. So, can the owner of the counseling business be sued/ removed from her position for doing this? Imo, the owner is being very greedy and selfish because all other clients that have the same insurance provider have been refused further services too. Her counselor is being overruled by her manager and she doesn't agree with what is going on.

legaladvice,Mechanic ship’s negligence caused popped tire,"I was driving to Canada on 1/16

Knowing this, I went to the mechanic shop and got an oil change and tire rotation on 1/11. 

In Canada, my tire popped. This was on flat land. Most likely because all four tires were way below minimum tread, that one of the exploded due to lack of material. 

This caused the need for towing, replacement of all four tires with run flats because they only had that in my cars size, and the drilling of one bolt for the wheel because the original tire rotation was too tight. 

This caused about 2k in costs, when a tire change would have been way less than 1k in the US, depending on the tires purchased. 

I asked them for compensation in change of what I would have paid had I replaced my tires in the US, versus what I had to pay due to their failure to tell me that my tires were at dangerous levels.

He recently got out of prison (for check fraud and credit card fraud) and she is afraid to call the police on him because she has warrants out for theft and trespassing when she used to be homeless but she's back on track now. She's worried if she calls they will take her baby away from her and arrest her.

The police have been at the apartment a few times in the past but I don't know what for. They were taking pictures of the outside for something and before in the past they knocked on our door saying if we see her boyfriend again to call and inform them. 

She is also afraid to call because of what might be in her apartment because he is doing drugs again and more. She doesn't know all of what he is doing right now because if she doesnt ask questions then he wont hurt her so she keeps to herself. He says he will try and take custody of the baby if she tries to leave.

Can she get arrested for calling the police on her boyfriend for violence? Will they take her baby away? Is there anything she can do to keep herself and the baby safe? Is it okay for her to call the police?

legaladvice,Patent Law &amp; Non Compete Question,"I work at a company that makes X widgets, I'm a mechanical engineer. We design X Widgets and it is a pretty simple product. The market is huge and a typical product goes out at a 75% markup on industrial products. Residential is about %30-50. This market tends to ""simple"" people who don't like a lot of change so the R&amp;D budgets are low for most companies we compete with, as well as mine. Our customers are not usually well educated... at least on the installation side.

It's pretty funny because all we do is redesign the wheel or add minimum bells and whistles. Only recently have we created a phone app to allow Bluetooth or wireless. I'm annoyed because the controller boards we design are very expensive, clunky, and outright unimpressive... That's what the market wants. Interestingly enough, I have designed more complex systems using an Arduino (off the shelf) microcontroller than what we do with our custom $60 dollar boards.

My point is this... I have some great ideas to create a new product. It will be simpler and undercut the market average cost with high enough quantities. I haven't begin designing it yet because I don't want to inadvertantly give any possession to my current employer. They won't like the idea anyways... but they'll be pissed if I make it myself. None of the information is trade secret because as I've said... it's all very basic. My idea will be tough to patent because of that... That means I need to hit the market hard and fast before anyone can create a competing product.

Located in the USA but market would be international

I never signed a non compete.

No trade secrets or information I didn't already know prior to employment. 

I haven't used work resources to do any of the work.

I am still employed by them. I do realize I would be in competition with my own employer and this would at a minimum mean getting fired.

legaladvice,Smoking issue,"Hi everyone!  I would like some advice regarding dealing with a smoker that below me in my apartment. The tenants below me smoke inside their own apartment and the smoke drifts up into my living room and bedroom. This occurs multiple time throughout the night, ranging from 7pm to 2am. I've made multiple attempts to come to a compromise me with the people downstairs about smoking outside the building, but they've in not so very kind words, told me to get lost essentially. The landlord is unwilling to help me anymore in this matter. He has sealed up the cracks in my bedroom, but it honestly didn't make any difference.

The smoke is really driving me crazy, it wakes me up in the middle of the night because I really can't breathe. I have this ongoing cough and itch in my throat since moving into the apartment. I've gone through numerous extremes to avoid being in my apartment because I am unwilling to risk my health.   I've proposed an early termination to my lease, but my landlord won't allow it.

I guess what I'm reading asking is, is this a legitimate basis to pursue legal action? The building lease was never listed as a smoke free, though there are TWO signs in the lobby stating that this is a smoking free establishment. I guess was convinced by the signs stating it was smoke free, which is why I picked the apartment. Prior to moving in, the landlord also made me sign a smoker free notice stating that there should be no smoking within the units, the lobby, or 15 feet from the building. Am I interpreting the signs wrong? The smoking tenants have lived their for over 30 years, so I'm not sure if the non-smoking signs even apply to them anymore.

legaladvice,Someone keeps breaking my dad’s car windows,"Throw away cause I’m not too sure how this all works. 

So, my dad parks his car on the street. Perfectly legally mind you. He knows where he has the rights to park and he abides by it. This one spot is slightly in front of our neighbors yard. This neighbor has always hated our household. That’s all the relevant info. 

So, a while back, the windows on my dad’s car were busted. You could clearly see the two failed impacts on the shattered remains of the window and the successful one the broke it in the end. We knew it had to be our neighbor and here’s why: 

-the windows broken were on a “beater” car 
-my dad owned and had a more valuable car parked in our driveway
-no other car besides the “beater” car was parked by the neighbors yard
-no other property was damaged
-none of the work equipment was stolen from the “beater” car (not even an ID badge from my dad’s work)
-our neighbor had called the cops on our household many times for dumb things like: “you can’t park there” (we could), “you can’t build there” (we could), and even “you’re abusing your animals” (we weren’t) 

It’s clear who did it and why. But now our neighbor has done it again. Police were notified both times. And now with more “proof”. The sports car in the driveway was unharmed as well. If some person wanted to smash the windows of a person’s car, why not do the most expensive car in sight? Plus, he tried to bash in the back window of the “beater” again. Same strike patterns as the first incident. But he gave up and went for the front window instead. 

So yeah. My dad was planning on installing cameras but with all the work he’s been doing, he never got around to it. I suggested putting a hidden security cam of some sort in the car itself and he’s thinking of his options. 

I wish we could actually bring our neighbor down, but without any hard evidence, we don’t have a leg to stand on. Is there anything we can do at all? Police are gonna come down soon to make a report and investigate or something. Should we just prepare for if he’s so dumb to try it again? Is there anything we can tell the police that will give them reason to suspect our neighbor other than our own experiences?"

Cause I really have told MANY people INCLUDING the managers where I work that my shoulder is injured and it is hard to push weight around with it. But yet Nothing changes.

legaladvice,Trusts and wills and POD,"An elderly friend asked me to help her. She is in Virginia 

Years ago she wrote her will 

In it, at the time, among other things she separately designated, she said that she said in her will that her stocks were in a family trust and that the trust was to go to person A and person B 

She was then advised to contact her broker and have it so her stocks would read that upon her death they would go into that family trust 

Now she has changed her mind and she has contacted her broker and changed that designation so that is is payable upon death to only one person - person A 

She was told by her broker that the POD will be sufficient and will override what is in the old will

She does not want to have to bother with re-writing her will if she does not have to.  If this takes care of the issue so that person A gets her stock upon her death she is happy.  She is quite elderly and does not leave her home.

I just got word this morning of my cousins (30M) situation, and I got the story from my Aunt so obviously I don't know all the facts but I'm confident what they told me was true. My cousin has had run-ins with the cops of that area before. He's been arrested before for substance abuse, but has been for the past 2 years on the road to recovery. He has shared that he still believes the officers of that area are prejudice against him. 

So according to him and his family, this morning he was driving on his way to work. He's driving on the highway and he merges lanes to pass a car in front of him. Behind him was a cop, my cousin said he wasn't driving a cop car so he must've been off-duty or something. The cop pulls him over, and it's from here that the story gets choppy. I don't know what the cop was accusing him of doing, an illegal turn or what, but somehow things escalate to the point where the cop pulls a gun out and arrests my cousin. He broke his jaw by hitting him with the butt of the gun, continued to beat him, and pointed the gun to my cousins head. They're claiming my cousin resisted arrest, but my cousin insists that he didn't do anything. They took him in and refused to offer medical treatment, and eventually let him go. He is in shock of what happened and his family is planning on getting a lawyer but is finding it difficult to find one that will take this case. He says that the cop seemed to have a camera on him, so he's hopeful it will prove his case. To me I can't think of anything he could've done to warrant that kind of behavior from a cop, and I'm just at a loss and feel helpless in this situation. So is there anything I can help him with, anything I can tell him that would help his case? They aren't even reporting it on the local news or anything, I'm just so frustrated.

So I sold my first car privately yesterday. After some back and forth and a test-drive it seemed to end well. Unfortunately I'm pretty ignorant about the title side of car sales and might've messed up. 

Towards the end of the sale when the cash was given to me with the car, I had my Mom sign the title as its in her name. The buyers part of the title was signed instead and we crossed it off. The sellers area was filled correctly. I talked to the lady and it seemed like it would be ""ok"" if my Mom crosses off the stuff she filled in the buyer section and put her initials right below it. 

I didn't see the buyers fill the paper work in but I have the cash and some messages from facebook and texts. The car wasn't registered or insured when I sold it. I took the plate off of the car. She said she has insurance.

legaladvice,Father Stole My Student Loans,"Instead of going into a long story about years of abuse (mental emotional and physical) and financial manipulation let me just start with the meat of the story. And i'm pretty sure there is nothing I can do now as its been 10 years since i first got the loans, but it can't hurt to ask.

My father had made it clear to me over the 4 years i was in high school that I should never take out student loans and instead work my way through school. Avoid putting myself in debt.

instead in my senior year of hs, his disability came up for review and his monthly amount was adjusted and he was receiving less money. He has an addiction to spending money on useless stuff that ends up hoarded and unopened. He decided then to push me into getting student loans. He manipulated me, which he is extremely good at, even knowing your being manipulated you will end up doing what he wants - always. So i got student loans in my name under my credit, and not the kind your parents co-sign on because he had just filed bankruptcy. 

As my student loan checks came every semester, he would put the checks into his own bank account, saying that he was going to help me manage the money and spend it responsibly (which made no sense since i was only going to spend on classes and books). instead he got me a credit card (in my name only) and had me use that to pay for my classes and books. My student loan money slowly disappeared without me using any of it and him continually buying things they should have had no money to afford. I'm now in $40,000 debt and struggling to pay interest. My credit card would get maxed and I could not pay it off cause i was not given any of the student loan money to cover it. i eventually had to drop out as I could not afford any more classes. 

I did get a job but he stole that money as well. when i moved out i was so financially in the hole that i've been struggling to get it fixed ever since. 

Even though this started 10 years ago (and he blew through the money in less than 2 years) is there anything I can do now?"

legaladvice,Being sued by the city for taxes,"Hello, like the title says I am being sued by my City for the amount of 12K. I was served earlier this morning with a code enforcement complaint. I am ordered to appear at a hearing on March 11, 2020 the description says ""Any person who fails to file tax returns timely or fails or refuses to pay the tax due timely.... subject to fine of 300 for each offense.....""

The dates given to me were from 2013 to 2018. I have always filed my taxes in a way before the given due dates and have never missed a single tax yet. I have my previous tax return forms filed from TurboTax from 2013 to present. I have no idea why they are suing me. do i need to lawyer up? I dont even know where to begin or which type of lawyer to find.  I do not wish for them to garner my wages, and i definitely do not have 12K in my bank to pay back this amount.

legaladvice,Car title questions (Arkansas),"I recently paid off my first car and my financing company sent me my title. My mom was a cosigner so the title has our names listed as:

My Name or My Mom's Name

My question is, does this mean that my mom does not have to be present or be a signer if I'm ever going to sell the car?

Also, it has a place to sign the title. Does she have to sign?

Finally, someone at the DMV told me that I didn't have to send it off to get a new one as long as I kept the title in a safe place. Is this a good thing to do?"
legaladvice,[USA] Can you trademark/copyright/patent a wristwatch dial?,"Edit: this is a question for all of the US but since I need to put a location, let's say New York.

If you're someone who is into watches you've probably noticed that a lot of watches are virtually identical.  For instance NTH watches look like clones of Rolex and Omega with different logos.  Evant made a copy of a Bregeut watch.  I thought things like design patents or trademarks could protect your brand if it had a certain image, but this does not seem to extend to watch dials.  Why is that?  Is there some precedence for watch dials in particular, or is it something about their nature?  I'm very curious about all this.

I have heard the UPS was able to trademark the color brown, but Rolex and Omega can't get trademarks for their unique dials?"
legaladvice,Student loan forgiveness program,"Hello!

legaladvice,Does my kids' mom have to pay for morning daycare?,"Our permanent orders document says:
&gt; Father’s overnights shall be on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Their daycare opens early enough for me to drop them off and still make it to work on time. Their school does not.

Does their daycare count as ""school"" in this case?

Unless I change jobs, my only alternatives are to give up overnights when they have school the next day--which is absolutely not the table--or to drop them off at their mom's house just so that she can drive them to school an hour later.

legaladvice,Helping sell estranged mother's house. Am I going to get sued?,"I'm helping my estranged mother sell her hoard house in Texas as she has moved into an assisted living facility. The house is in poor condition and I have finally found an investor crazy enough to buy it for a more than fair price. He emailed me the contract and it it very standard (had realtor friend review). After review and some negotiating I forwarded the final doc to my mother to sign via DocuSign (investor set it up), and she did. I later found out that she had put the house into the name of her living trust and I have been trying to get the trust docs from her to provide to the title company. She seems to be intentionally ignoring this request and being weird about it. Closing is in a week so I'm a bit panicked. I went back to the contract to make sure that there was nothing further she needed to provide when I noticed all the signatures on the contract showed my name. This looks like a DocuSign issue, not intentional on my mom's part. 
My questions are: if the sale doesn't go through because she's not providing the required docs do I have any legal liability? If the sale does go through (I do not plan on being at closing) and she decides she didn't want to sell, do I have any legal liability?

If you want more details why I'm asking this keep reading. My mother has mental health issues (formal diagnosis is bat shit crazy and looking for something to be mad about). We are estranged because no one's needs that kind of negativity in their life. My father, her ex-husband (divorced for 30+ years, died last year and I have found out she contacted several lawyers over several months looking for one that would help her get part of his estate...things that were left to HER children. I found out she tried to get money from her sisters estate by claiming she was actually her daughter not sister. She scammed a charitable organization getting them to do free work on her house (she has money). She short paid an electrician who did work on her house and threatened to sue him for something he didn't do if he didn't walk away. She has 5 children and each of us has cut ties with her. This isn't even the tip of the iceberg, just the crap she's pulled in the past year."
legaladvice,Downstairs neighbors sending formal noise complaints. Is there a chance we could get evicted?,"My girlfriend and I live in Manhattan, New York in an old building with creaky floors which have no sound insulation. We’ve been here for a little less than a year and we get  consistent complaints from our downstairs neighbors about sound. They have already sent in a formal complaint a few months ago but nothing came of it, so I suspect they canceled it. But they’ve basically threatened to submit more and they complain a lot.

There are two things they complain about, so any information about the strength of their complaints regarding either issue would be appreciated.

1. Our cats. Our cats are young and play with each other every couple of hours. Note that our bedroom is located directly above our downstairs neighbors. At night our cats would make a ton of noise and keep the neighbors up.

We’ve made multiple efforts to help: we bought a large thick area rug for our bedroom, we keep the cats outside of the bedroom from 11pm onwards (that’s when the neighbors go to bed), and we bought a large kennel to keep the cats in for the night. We have to cage them because we can’t leave them in the living room alone with our guineas pigs, and we can’t let them run around our room at night. Since I always feel guilty about caging our cats, I’ve completely changed my sleep schedule so that I can cage the cats as late as possible and then wake up early to let them into the room, at the same time that the neighbors wake up (7-8am).

So far I’ve been caving the cats at 3am, I go to sleep, I wake up at 8am to let them out, then go back to sleep. My issue is that I don’t want to do this for the entire time I live here. Are their complaints valid or can I stop doing this?


2. Our footsteps and use of doors. They go to sleep around 11pm every night. If we walk around in our room anytime afterwards they say they wake up. We have to literally tiptoe around and close our doors as quietly as possible. I hate this. I hate having to tiptoe around my room at night and make note of which areas creak the least. Are their complaints valid?

legaladvice,Employer canceled my spouses health insurance with no warning,"Edited to add location: Minnesota, United States 

I’m going to try and make this as short and simple as possible. I started with a new company in 9/2019. After 60 days of employment I was eligible for benefits. I enrolled my spouse and I in 11/2019. I was notified I had 60 days to upload a copy of my marriage certificate to prove dependency status. I didn’t have a copy handy so I made a mental note. I got a reminder email on 12/09/2019 to upload the certificate as proof as dependent status. On 12/11/2019 I uploaded a copy of my marriage certificate via my smartphone on the benefits website. Or at least I thought I did. On 1/7/2020 I received an email stating my spouses coverage was terminated because they failed to receive a copy of the marriage certificate. I called the third party vendor who handles our benefits and they advised me to fill out an appeal. I was also told that it was likely the reason that the marriage certificate was never received because I attempted to do it via smartphone rather than using a computer. I was also notified at that time that it would be no problem to get the coverage reinstated. I should also mention that my spouse has fallen under some health issues as of late and has racked up a few doctors visits just this month. I was also told when I called that when the coverage was reinstated it would be retroactive to the date it was cancelled and any medical visits would be covered. I got a phone call on Monday. So I filled out an appeal and upload my marriage certificate via computer as instructed. I filled out the appeal on 1/8. On Monday 1/20 I was notified via phone call that my appeal was denied by my employer and the benefits vendor could not tell me why. After a lot of back and forth I finally reached someone within my company and was told the appeal was denied because they didn’t receive proof of my marriage certificate before the deadline. I received no notification that it hadn’t been received and was essentially told we were out of luck until open enrollment. I plan to file a complaint with the department of labor for a suspected ERISA violation but is there anything legally speaking I can do? Do I even have a case in anything? I’m very frustrated because of the impending medical bills that we may now have to pay out of pocket and I’m not sure what else to do. Any advice is welcome.

legaladvice,Company did not withhold federal taxes?,"Gonna keep this short, so I appreciate any advice.

My girlfriend worked at a hair salon where she was hired as a stylist. Didn't need to rent a booth or anything. She didn't realize until recently that her employer did not withhold federal taxes from any of her paychecks.

legaladvice,[NY] Can My Employer Move My Resignation Date Up Two Months Legally?,"New York State.  I'll give cliffs, but can give more information if necessary.

TL;DR - Legally is this still a resignation or is this a termination?

&amp;#x200B;

I sent out a letter on Thursday (1/23/2020) saying that my final day at work would be Friday, March 27th.  My job had really been stressing me out, but I knew that I was one of only two people trained to even attempt it, and the other has his hands full which is why I gave so much notice.  New York State is at-will and my employee handbook said two weeks were necessary to cash out PTO.  I sent out this notice to both HR and the department heads that I work with, including a plan to help make the transition as smooth as possible because a lot of people relied on me.

Friday afternoon (1/24), I got called into HR and was told that it was my last day.  This was not totally unexpected, but I was surprised because again, nobody else can do my job supporting the other departments.

However, my paperwork (which I did not sign because sadly I made this mistake once before several years ago) incidated that I was resigning as of 1/24 and had my COBRA health benefits.  HR got mad at me for refusing to sign.

I honestly don't regret giving that much advance notice because of my conscience (some of the departments are going to be messed up on Monday), but now I'm worried about committing fraud.

Questions:

1. Was I unprofessional in including the department heads in my notification?  My friends and family don't seem to think so, but I also know their biased towards me.
2. Does my company have the right, as HR claimed, to move up my resignation date nine weeks without my consent?  My concern is that I file for unemployment on Monday in New York State, and I'm pretty certain it will go to a hearing because they are going to contest it, I get into legal trouble for committing fraud.  I did NOT sign the resignation paperwork but HR said that my email was considered good enough.
3. Can I still get COBRA if my employer insists I sign a resignation letter?  I would like to keep health benefits.

legaladvice,Father in-law was rushed to the ER from work due to Cabon monoxide poisoning,"Fort Worth , TX.  TD:LR at the bottom 


   Sorry for the format I'm on mobile, alright strap in guys and girls, My father in law was at work 2 days ago and around 1:30 he was doing the usual, driving a forklift, moving this here and there until he took a breath and his nose started burning, took a second breath and his chest started hurting and took a 3rd bearth and his lungs started burning. At that point he was freaking out because that's never happened to him before.

   Almost immediately two of his Co workers come up to him and ask him if he smelled something burning to which he said yes, so they called the fire department and told them what they smelled and how it felt like it was burning them. The fire department arrives and they check their carbon or oxygen levels  and this guys level was at 5, the other at 15 and my father in laws at 8, so they call up and ambulance and they were taken to the hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning.

    A little bit later he is told by one of his Co workers that the fire department went to a place that's at a fair distance away from them and asks them if they knew about what had just happened, apparently that place tests bombs chemicals , or it's a military training ground and at that time they said they were testing CS gas and said that it might have traveled further than expected.


    My father in law was told yesterday he'd be released as soon as his levels were below a 3 and while nearing the 3 mark they went up to 6 and down to a 5 between 2hr intervals so he was told that if his levels continued to fluctuate they'd have to send him to Dallas and out him in a chamber were he'd be breathing pure oxygen.


   Does my father in law have a case here? He has filed for workers comp but it's not sure who will pay, it was not his jobs fault but he was at work while that happened but its the other places fault that it happened.

legaladvice,"[MA] Condo Seller changed Master Deed with other unit owners, removing clause pertaining to my property, then sold the property to me [Buyer] with a different version of docs.","So, this is an odd one...My wife and I bought our first family home (one unit of a 3-unit house) under the understanding that the Master deed (condo docs) allowed for the possibility of us developing a parking space in our common yard area. This was a big deal for us, as parking spaces are worth $20-40K in our neighborhood. This was also clearly articulated in the Master Deed.

A few years later, my wife and I broached the parking space subject with the other owners. They showed us a photo of the same Master Deed with that specific paragraph crossed out. It had all of the owners' (including our units former owner's) initials and the word ""remove."" This was dated a few days after our offer was accepted but before closing.

 That said, there is a clause in the Master Deed that states:

***Amendment***\*. This Master Deed may be amended by an instrument in writing (a) signed by all the owners of Units and (b) signed and acknowledged by all of the Trustees of the \[address\] Condominium Trust and (c) duly recorded with \[our county\] Registry of Deeds, PROVIDED HOWEVER that:\*

*(a)  The date on which any such instrument is signed by a Unit Owner shall be indicated thereon as the date thereof and no such instrument shall be of any force or effect unless the same has been recorded within (6) months after such date;*

*(b)  No instrument or amendment affecting any Unit upon which there is a first mortgage of record held by a bank or insurance company shall be of any force or effect unless the same has been assented to by the holder of such mortgage; and*

*(c)  No instrument of amendment which alters the Master Deed in any manner which would render it contrary or inconsistent with any requirements or provisions of Chapter 183A shall be of any force or effect.*

I can understand why the other unit owners might not have wanted that clause in there, but it seems deeply unethical for the Seller to do this. Is this legal and binding? A lawsuit? Something we can ignore?

legaladvice,Can I sue an Employer for allowing theft to happen and not doing anything about it?," I work in a Casino and we don't have personal lockers.  Instead, what we have are personal garment bags which are for ALL of our personal belongings.  These Garment bags are accessible via a sliding glass door which has a conveyor type system (Similar to dry cleaning).  In order to access your bag, you need to input your employee ID number.  Our employee numbers are hardly a secret to anyone.  Anyone who wanted to find the number of any specific person could easily do so with hardly any effort.  That being said, there's plenty of cameras in the hallway where this area is.

Last night I fell victim to theft.  Some bastard stole $1200 from my wallet, but left everything else.   Why I have $1200 is because I typically have a lot of cash on me in general.  Whether its smart or not, is another issue entirely.  One of two things could have happened:  1)  Person input my number on the electronic display, then accessed my bag; or 2) Person put another persons number that has a garment bag CLOSE to mine, and accessed it from there (Every time a garment bag is rotated, there is enough access for about 3-4 separate bags).  If it is the first option, Security and surveillance should be able to cross reference my number and at what times I accessed it.  Any other times would be obviously suspect.  The 2nd option, much more difficult.  Not sure how I would solve that issue.

I've reported this to security and even was advised that other people have gotten items stolen previously.  So my question for this thread is the following:  If your garment bag isn't even safe for your personal items, and we're told to keep them in there as there is no other place to put them, AND the company isnt providing a more secure option like lockers, can I hold them liable?  Because I'm 99% sure I wont be seeing this money again based on security and surveillance's lack of assistance in helping me.  Also, the fact that people have gotten items stolen before should send red flags up the pole and my management should do their due diligence of advising people to keep items in their wardrobe bag at their own risk.  My work had created a false sense of security, and yet they make it so easy for someone else to access your bag at anytime.

Thats all, thanks for your help!"

We live in Maryland, and we can't tell any of our parents as we would almost definitely be disowned. This probably rules out insurance, so we would have to pay cash. I have no money and she has around $200. According to Planned Parenthood, abortions can cost upwards of $800 depending on how long she has been pregnant (in our case, that is probably around four weeks). Before we get the abortion we would have to get blood work done to see if she is actually pregnant, which costs over $50.

legaladvice,How to get justice for charity theft,"I run a nonprofit organization that hosts an annual fundraiser to raise money to buy Lego sets for underprivileged children. In our last fundraiser a buyer from GA purchased a $450 item and claimed that the package was never received. She had it shipped to a PO box and the tracking showed the package reached the delivery destination but then got rerouted to a different zip code, so she filed a PayPal claim and won. I filed an investigation with USPIS and they verbally confirmed that their internal system shows the package was picked up from the original delivery address, but they're not sure why the tracking showed the package going to another location. I got USPIS on a 3-way call with me and PayPal to provide the verbal evidence and get our money back.

This buyer had a track record of suspicious activity. In 2017 they also ordered from us and 4 months later claimed the package never arrived. Unfortunately back then the sender of the package didn't have the tracking info so we sent her a replacement order free of charge. Now that I have more concrete proof of mail fraud, I want to make sure the buyer doesn't walk away without any repercussions for theft from charity. She has not responded to any of our emails to confirm whether she got the package after the new info provided by USPIS. I reached out to her by phone and she is denying of even placing the order and says she will forward our emails to the real buyer. She is not likely to respond to whether she got the package since either answer can be used to incriminate her. Is there anything I can do from my end to make sure justice is served?

My SIL on the other hand, has a two-year degree in administrative assistance (her words, I wasn’t even aware that’s a thing?), she has had little to no part in his business operations and development over the years. Nonetheless, they have been married for 28 years now. Divorce has been approaching a toxic pinnacle for a long, long time. 
Now, I can’t say what my BIL has been trying to accomplish prior to my SIL serving him with divorce papers, but he has had several consults with different attorneys before this and also had a conversation with her about mediation for divorce. 
I am skimming over some details but I get the impression that he was gunning to settle outside of court. It was clear he didn’t want to involve lawyers and seems to be attempting to dodge paying her what she may be legally entitled to. Even so far as making a ‘valuation’ on their home that is grossly below the actual value. 
There have been some notable changes in his behavior on social media which I believe to be his attempt at preparation for custodial placement of their child. 
Other things he’s done as an example, happened while the two engaged in a heated argument, my BIL pulled out his phone and announced he’s recording her as my SIL was screaming and (apparently, though not confirmed) attempted to physically assault him. Obviously, that is not acceptable behavior on her behalf, but she states that he has been verbally harassing to her from the very beginning. She says his behavior has escalated to the point of verbal abuse in public or in front of their daughter. 
My SIL has had some serious mental-health issues over the last couple years. She voluntarily checked herself in to a mental health facility and remained a patient for a few months while receiving treatment for major depressive disorder and issues related to anxiety. She stated in her own words that prior to seeking treatment she suffered a mental break and felt her current medications were no longer helping her. She has since recovered from that time and on a healthy medication regiment now. 
His changes in behavior to our friends and family is now suddenly reclusive about his business and financial statuses and unusually vague about his business investments. 
I guess my question here is, what’s a realistic expectation about my BIL's business? Will child placement be affected by any attempts made to make my SIL look crazy? What will happen if my BIL fraudulently under value's his business assets and their home?"

legaladvice,[MO] Building owner ignoring complaints about music studio,"I live in a small mixed-use building containing both businesses and residential units. The top couple floors are condos (not rental properties) and the lower floors are office space. At some point the building owner decided to build a music studio/event space on the floor immediately below the lowest level of residential units.

The owner claims that they have invested extensively in sound insulation for the space, but the residential owners debate this claim as normal speaking voices can be heard clearly from the upstairs spaces when the ""studio"" space is in use. Obviously complete silence is an unreasonable expectation, but regularly the operator of the ""studio"" has groups in the space, either for recording or just for parties, that run well into the morning playing music through the PA system. To make matters worse it is pretty common for the heavy smell of pot to bleed up into the residential floors during these events. 

The condo owners have repeatedly voiced concerns about the business to try to negotiate a solution and the owner of the building dismisses all of them, saying they cannot control what happens in the space and refusing to provide information about the terms of the lease for that business, including operating hours. Police have been called multiple times for noise, but like most parties the people in the space will quiet down briefly before going back to what they were doing. I've used a phone app to measure the noise in one of the hallways of the residential floors during a recent event and it measured as high as 80 decibels bleeding into the condo spaces.

We are at our wit's end and considering retaining an attorney to deal with this. What recourse might we have in this situation? What is the recommended course of action to deal to get the owner to abate the noise problem or, failing that, restrict the operating hours of the business?"

Now 20 something years later one of the criminals is being released soon and has already delivered indirect threats through 3rd party persons to finish the job.

legaladvice,[OR] Can the police tell you that you are under arrest if they don't actually have a warrant for your arrest?,"A friend of mine had her home raided by the police. At the time, she was the only one at the house. Instead of knocking on the door and showing her the warrant, the cops had a friend of hers call, saying they urgently needed her to come help them. 

She walked out to the street to leave, but before she could get to her car, two vans pulled up right in front of her and a bunch of armed officers jumped out. One of them said her name and that she was under arrest, then grabbed her, handcuffed her, and pushed her into one of the vans. They took her about a mile away from the house, at which point they then read her the search warrant, then had her sit and wait for over an hour while a detective tried to question her.  By the time they drove her back home, the police had already broken into the house (damaging property in the process) and had begun to search.
 
My question is, are the police legally allowed to ""arrest"" you without having an arrest warrant for you, or having actually witnessed you committing a crime? I was under the impression that you did not have to go with officers unless they were actually arresting you, but she definitely wasn't given much of a chance to object. I know police are allowed to lie, but can they go as far as to tell you that you are under arrest if they don't actually mean it?

There was a search warrant for the property, as well as a warrant to search (but not to arrest) multiple residents of the property, including herself. Does that alone give police the authority to essentially kidnap a person off the side of the road? I know that the ""knock and announce"" rule that normally pertains to search warrants is more of a guideline that can be dispensed with for a lot of different reasons, but it hardly seems like a 25 year old girl without any prior criminal record whatsoever would be enough of a threat to merit a dozen heavily armed officers kidnapping her off the side of the road, even if they thought there might have been guns in the home.

legaladvice,Vehicle search question,"We live in Minnesota.   
Last night my 17 year old son was out in a car with several other underage (under 18) kids. His friend was driving. Because the defrost wasn't working, they were pulled over for frosty windows impeding vision. The officer stated he smelled nicotine in the car, at which point the driver said his mom uses the car and smokes, and her stuff was in the glove box. Which is true. Then they asked to search the car, the driver consented. They found tobacco products in my son's backpack and he was cited for underage tobacco possession. (we are dealing with that end of things with him, of course).  The driver was also cited due to the tobacco (my son's stuff and his mom's stuff) being in the car he was driving since he is under legal age.

My older, uninvolved son is arguing that they illegally searched my son's bag without asking permission. I thought the permission given by the driver was a blanket permission to search everything in the car. Is this potentially contestable due to the fact they did not get permission to search my son's backpack specifically considering it did not belong to the boy who gave permission for the search?   


FWIW this is more a curiosity question than anything as I've been unable to find it spelled out anywhere. As his mom, I am tending to let him deal with the citation and pay the fine for being dumb because I think he needs to learn the lesson. BUT learning proper rights for search and seizure is important, too."

legaladvice,"Tax Deduction? Divorced and I pay for half of childs needs; however its not child support, but also not voluntary","Hello there! 

When I'm doing my taxes it always asks me about my child so I've always been curious about getting a real answer about potential tax breaks. (Texas) 

In our divorce decree child plan; there is a line that says none of us pay child support, but instead, that we have agreed to split our sons needs (medical, school, programs, etc...). She claims our child on taxes, I don't. I pay her, directly, half of everything for our child. I've always felt that I should be able to claim the money I'm sending her which is supporting our child?

So when it comes to tax time I'm not paying 'Child Support' so I don't check that box. I'm also not really playing 'Alimony' (I don't think?)... so I don't check that one either. However, this piece of paper from the court (Divorce paper) says that ""both parties have agreed to split costs so no child support amount is needed"". 

So then there's this line on TurboTax trying to explain things to me under the ""Alimony Paid"" area: ""Payments you made **voluntarily** that are **not** identified in a divorce or separate agreement as alimony"" - To me... technically my payments aren't voluntarily?.. I only pay her half because it's stated/identified in that document. But... it's not officially alimony, right? Shouldn't she have to report the money I'm giving her as income, and it's an expense toward supporting a child on my end? 

This has always lead me to believe I got the bad end of the stick, and that she took advantage of me again.. and I just have to deal with it?

I'm basically looking for a ""Yep, she got ya."" or ""Nope, you can claim that."" haha. Appreciate ya reading through my confusion!"
legaladvice,Repayment of taxed retention bonus,"Sorry for what might be a repost - I’ve seen several threads on this with mixed advice. Here is my scenario:

legaladvice,Should I be able to control the heat in my own rental unit?,"About 4 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to move to Utah on a whim and start our lives away from our family. We noticed the cost of living is wayyy wayy cheaper than that of California so we were stoked. We scoured for some rental units that would suit our needs while we were starting out and found one that was posted for $875 per month for rent and it was inclusive of pets as well as we have a dog (Who is kind of a big boy) and a tiny cat. 

We jumped on the opportunity and took the rental unit, what we noticed was great was that water, sewage, and trash was included in the rental price. Once we got down to the lease they explained that they would also cover gas but that it was ""split"" amongst the tenants. ""Sure, great, that's included too."" We thought. Our total rent including pet rent is *supposed* to be $985 per month (Not including gas because according to the agent at our management company that drew up the lease our gas was supposed to only be ""$20 tops"" her words exactly) 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then we have had our water to our kitchen and bathroom randomly stop.. at one point the water in the kitchen came out orange. Maintenance didn't come to fix it until about a week after I put in that request.. and our gas bill has been $100+ every month bringing our rent over $1100.. not only that but we have come to find out that we cannot control our heat in any of our units, and it is part of a ""quadplex."" Our heat comes from a ""Master Heater"" that is attached to an apartment building also owned by the management company that is adjacent to our quadplex. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point you're probably thinking this place is a dream.. Well as of this last Monday we noticed that in our second bedroom there was black mold growing out of the wall, on the window sill, and it was also within the wall. We touched the walls and they were soaked in condensation (because again.. we can't control our own heat) and it gets so hot in our apartment that the walls and windows start sweating. We submit a request for maintenance relatively early in the day and no response, except the automated responses saying our request was submitted.

&amp;#x200B;

So we call the next day to state the urgency and THEN they send someone out to clean up the mold. The women are really nice but instantly notice that this was not just a clean up job. They stated they would let the management company know and that we need to request they send someone out ASAP., AND that this wasn't the first time they noticed a lack of effort on the company or owner's part in regards to the heat or mold.

&amp;#x200B;

Maintenance came out the same day and stated that there was no way they could handle it on their own and that they would need a specialist. Now they are coming out on Monday with a specialist to examine the extent of the mold within the walls.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and I feel this could have all been avoided had we been able to control our heat.. I mean you touch the walls and its hot to the touch, the floors next to the radiators are also hot. We have been living in 30 degree weather when our apartment feels like 80+. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got done washing the dishes and I'm dripping sweat from my nose. My question is should we, as renters in the state of Utah be able to control our heat? Is what they're doing and how they are handling our complaints legal? 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like every time we bring up a concern they just kind of blow us off and communicate ""Thats the way it works.. sorry.""

I've just about had it, the mold is what brought me over the edge.. this is now a health hazard.

&amp;#x200B;

My apologies for any errors in my spelling or grammar,  we are mainly just looking for answers because, based upon the articles and legal chapters we've read so far we don't *feel* like it's legal, but we thought we'd seek other opinions before getting ahead of ourselves."
legaladvice,Can I be compensated for the costs of repairing my catalytic converter?,"I work as a teacher's assistant for a high school in the US through a partner organization. I am considered an employee of the county but not a teacher (do not tell me to contact my union rep). The school recently changed their policy so that the lot that many employees from my organization park in is locked at 7am (allegedly to keep students from skipping but that is a lie because most students do not arrive until 7:15-7:30). Because of this change in policy, we were told to park in the teacher lot, which is full by the time we arrive, or on the street, even though there is plenty of parking in the locked lot. The day after this change in policy, I was forced to park on a side street because the teacher's lot was full and the streets were lined with student's cars and someone tried to saw off my catalytic converter. I filed a police report and have confirmation from the repair shop that someone tried to saw it off. I tried to file a claim with the school since this is the direct result of their change in policy. Cars in the school's lots are not bothered but incidents like this are common in the area, and if it were not for this arbitrary change I would have parked in the lot like I did before where cars are not bothered. But the school administrator is refusing to sign off on my claims report. I have an email record of the change in policy, a police report, confirmation from the repair shop, and proof that I had to miss work to sort this out. Can I take the county to a small claims court? The administrator? How should I handle the situation?"

I am visually impaired and am NOT on disability so i do NOT have an income nor do I have any money in general. No one is currently living at the house. The deed to the house is in my name (and I believe mine alone because only I signed. I will look at the dead later). No loan was taken out to purchase the home. He paid it in cash directly to the previous owner over a period of a year or 2. The home is fully paid off. My father is still working on the house and is there several days a week working on it. Right now we do not know if he plans to sell it or move us all in there.  Lastly my location is Pennsylvania (PA).**

5 years ago at the age of 20, my mom told me out of the blue that I would be signing for a house in a few days. Back then I thought nothing of it. I went to the real estate office with my parents and they made me sign. I know now that I shouldnt have went and signed for the house but in my eyes I didnt have a choice back then and I didnt know of any of the possible consequences. My father once forced my brother to enroll in ITT tech and he got a degree he never used or even wanted and he now has student loans from Sallie Mae... So as you can see my parents pretty much have a lot of control over us and are no strangers to destroying our financial well being.

There were 0 issues with the house until fall 2018 when I received the first notice. My father had been fixing up the house for at least 2 years before they sent a letter saying I (but actually he) needed a building permit to be making repairs/renovations. They sent several notices threatening to charge me egregious fees (up to thousands a day I believe it was) if I do not comply with the notice by either ceasing work on the house altogether, getting a permit, or hiring a licensed contractor to do the work. All the while I had absolutely NOTHING to do with the house. In fact I have never even stepped foot in it before. As you can imagine this gave me a lot of stress. I am legally blind and unemployed and have no money or income. I couldnt do anything about the fines if I would get any. After running back and forth to downtown the notices seemed to stop coming. I think my dad got the building permit without me (idk how cuz I was the one who was supposed to get one).

Since then I was able check out all the different code violations associated with the house online and there seems to have been a lot in the past couple of years. I hadnt received any fines of any kind from the first incident or any of the ones after until this past December. They said there was litter around the house in November and that we owed the city 50 dollars. My sister found the unopened letter on the date the money was due. They sent another notice 2 weeks ago with a late fee of $25, so now I owe the city $75. My father said he is not gonna pay them cuz there was no trash in front of the house.

I am constantly worried about being sued by the city or this showing up on my credit (not that it is any good anyway but not their fault). I am completely innocent and I hate that my dad is ruining my name. I dont know what to do and I dont know how to get the house off my name. I have told my mother several times that I want the house off of my name but it has not happened yet and I dont know if it ever will unless he sells it. I have no clue what to do. How do I get my dad to pay the fee? How do I get the house off of my name? Should I just use their debit cards or a check to pay it myself without their permission? There is an option to go to a hearing but in all honesty I want NOTHING to do with this bs. I just want it to be over. Because the house is in my name and the notices are addressed to me, I think I would have to be the one that appears. (Also the money is due tomorrow.)

Location: Pennsylvania

TLDR: 5 years ago my parents had me sign for a house and the past 2 years have been nothing but stressful. My dad is repairing and renovating the home and has been committing several code violations according to the city and it all falls on me. Because the house is in my name I get the notices and I get fined for things I have nothing to do with. My dad is refusing to pay a $75 fine that will grow and I dont know how get out of this mess. I fear legal consequences in the future.

Edit 2: A few people are telling me to sell the house. Even tho I legally could do that it would only cause big problems. I live with both of my parents. Doing something like that would be kinda fcked up and I am sure yall know that. Of course this whole situation sucks, but I couldnt do that in good conscience. I would like a peaceful solution to the matter if possible. Also I believe there was no loan taken out for the house and if so, the house has already been paid in full by now so it doesnt matter."
legaladvice,Downstairs Neighbors complaining about noise (college town),"I currently go to a very large SEC University in Tennessee, and live in the off campus neighborhood where all the college kids and fraternities live once they no longer have to live in dorms (after freshman year). (This entire neighborhood is occupied with 1000+ college students).

Once the weekend hits, as you would expect, the neighborhood gets loud with music and parties and this includes me and my roommates in our condominium. We have downstairs neighbors who are not the party type and because of this, have previously called the cops on us without talking to us first about our noise. The cops understood it was the weekend and politely asked us to keep the music down which we did. Since this we have taken precautions to prevent our music from bothering them. 

Now, things have began to change and they have started knocking on our door telling us to to turn the music down and just recently came to our door to yell and swear at us about our music (which we were listening to on a late afternoon Saturday while watching our university basketball game). 

Since they came to our door and started yelling at us and being very rude, my roommate (who is a hot head)  got angry back with them and now the situation seems to have escalated.  Because of this I now feel the cops are going to be the primary ones coming to our door. 

Since the cops are going to be coming more often (I’m guessing), I’m curious what that might entail? I have apologized to neighbors in the past and to help, we have placed folded towels under our speaker to prevent noise from going through the floor and have kept our music volume down in comparison to how it was before. 

So overall, 
We only listen to music on the weekends and it only lasts between 8pm and 10:00 pm so are we in the wrong for this?
Is there any sort of legal action that can be used against us as I understand we are the ones causing the noise? 

P.S. I clearly understand we look like assholes but it’s hard to not get annoyed as we live in a college neighborhood and enjoy to have fun on the weekends as does every other resident in this neighborhood. We never deliberately play music to annoy them and always keep them in mind when listening as we don’t want the cops or them coming to our door. 

Be honest and call me an asshole if I am one."
legaladvice,I want to file a GRIEVANCE against my attorney with the STATE BAR,"I was the plaintiff in a civil suit in Dallas, Texas.  The suit went on for a long period of time.  In the last days it became clear to me that my lawyer had been doing a lousy job.  At that point my lawyer recommended that I drop the lawsuit, which I did.  In the final invoice my lawyer charged me for 20% of her costs over the last billing period (waiving charges for 80% of her final invoice), knowing that she did a poor job (consciousness of guilt).  Since then I’ve discovered at least 10 major issues with my lawyers work.  It has been more than a year since the suit was dropped.  I’m thinking of filing a grievance against my lawyer with the state bar.  By filing the grievance I hope to warn other people that she’s a bad lawyer.

1. What will come out of a grievance like this?  Will she get just a slap on the wrist?  Will the bar look at this fairly, or do they tend to side-with/protect lawyers?  Anything else I need to know about filing a grievance?
2. I have not paid the 20% portion of the final invoice because I didn’t feel she earned it.  She has not requested payment since the original invoice, more than a year ago.  Note that the original amount owed is small enough to be a ”small claims court” issue.  What legal action could I face regarding this payment issue when she finds out I’m filing a grievance?  What is the statute of limitation for her to pursue legal action?

Parents have a joint account with a family member that is used for a co-owned vacation rental property. My parents sold their share to the family member on January 15th. On the 16th my parents took out their share of the rental income they were owed. So obviously they were still on the account.

Family member is now threatening to sue my parents for ""a felony crime"" (he didn't specify) since my parents ""did not have ownership or permission to do anything with that account."" He claims since he was sole owner of the property starting Jan 15th that he was also sole owner of all money in the joint account. I've read over the contract they signed for the sale and it doesn't say anything about the joint bank account. It may be important to note that family member took out over $1k from the account on the 13th of January, so my parents were worried they were not going to see any of their money.

Family member is pissed because HOA fees are due and when my parents took out their share of rental income there was no longer enough to pay the HOA fee. Important to note if $1k+ family member took out what still in the account there would have been enough.

My parents put back $1k when the family member asked them to, but he did not ask for more than that and said he didn't need the money now (he literally told me that), and his anger wasn't about the money. Family member took out all of the remaining money in the account prior to my parents putting back $1k.

So looking back at the texts between me and family member he said ""Actually I don't even need that (see: money) now, I just want them to call me to talk and work this out... I want the to agree to talk about a fair way to account for the money in the Condo account. I will be totally fair on that but they did that without my knowledge and they are really still owners of the condo because they don't legally become no owners until next week."" This was on January 16th, the day my parents took out the money. So he's claiming they weren't owners so they had no right to any of the money but also told me the day they took the money that they are still owners for a week. I don't know man.

Just wondering if the family member has a leg to stand on. Parents live in FL, family member in VA, property in CO.

Edit: on the 16th of January he agreed (his idea) with  both myself and my parents separately to a mediator of my parents choosing to ""settle up the account."""
legaladvice,Leaky toilet driving up my bill but not being fixed!,"In my house, there is a toilet that trickles. It does this every few minutes and is driving up my water bill. My roommate has made the property manager aware but we have received no response. I read that since it doesn’t make the house inhabitable that it’s not required to be fixed, but I can’t keep paying high water bills just because of this. I was kind of curious if my landlord/property manager would have to pay our water bill if they’re aware but not fixing it? Because I don’t want to try to fix it and wreck something and then have that taken out of my deposit or anything but I also can’t pay an extra $100+ for month just for this. For perspective, the units of water used normally in my house are about 4-6 but with the toilet running it’s gone up to like 24-27 units. I’m just unsure what to do and what I’m allowed to do and what my landlord is required to do.

legaladvice,A roommate situation,"So, my roomie in Denmark has continually promised to fix our WiFi. He is the owner of our house, and has been charging us about 15$ a month for WiFi. Sometime WiFi works and sometimes it doesn’t, but this month was horrible. 

In January the WiFi has not been working at all, and because I am a freelancer and work from home 50% of the time, I have been using mobile data. I told him several times that the WiFi is terrible and I’m surviving in data, and that it’s getting expensive. He promised to fix it. But it hasn’t been fixed still. And soon a big phone bill will arrive because of all the data I had to buy. 

Our contract doesn’t mention anything about WiFi or anything that could be used to solve this. But I suggested the mobile data money come out of the rent - as I didn’t buy it for my own amusement, but simply because he failed to provide a basic need for the household. He obviously does not agree with this, and thinks it should not come out of my rent. 

Could you please help me with how to solve this? The bill is almost on 200$. 

Thanks!"
legaladvice,"I found out my employees were taking money from the safe, then replacing the money the next day.

I just want him to know the seriousness of the situation and acts like I’m over reacting because I said no one has access to the money. They use to have access so they can put away cash drops or get change. No I got a second locker for cash drops to go temporarily. 

I don’t have proof but I think they just hit up a bunch of people for weed they find a guy take the money buy the weed, then go to the bank the next day to put the money back. I know they’re all pot heads and smoke their pens on the clock.

legaladvice,How long is the statute of limitations for taking a business to court over tax fraud?,"I worked for an employer when I was 17 (I'm 21 now) where I filled out a W-2 but she forged my info and signature onto a 1099 and gave me personal checks with the tax deducted from them while no taxes were actually taken from my checks because of the 1099 situation. As a 17 year old, I didn't think much of it until my tax return had come in the following January and showed as me owing money. I wanted to fight this in court and take said small business owner to court, but my parents forbid it and I wasn't sure if a 17 year old could take someone to court in Illinois. Now that I've finally got my life together enough to afford a lawyer, I'd really like to see if I can still take her to court and show her she can't pull the wool over everyone's eyes like this. I know I'm not the only employee she's done this to and I'm PRETTY sure you can't file a minor as an independent contractor, which is what she claimed I was. 
Because I only worked for her for a five month period before moving to Michigan, I only ended up owing around $300 (she paid minimum wage, claimed we would get tips, but then would come in before shift end and raid the tip jar). 

Note: she also refused to pay anyone past when they were scheduled and we weren't allowed to kick out customers to close the store. So if someone came in at 7:50 and stayed til 8:45, I couldn't clean the lobby until then and I'd be there til about 9:15 doing so since she kept soup in a crock pot out front (also probably not safe, from what I know that isn't foodservice standard) but I'd only get paid til 8. Even if I recorded that I was there until 9:15 on the stupid calendar she used for people to clock in and out on instead of having any kind of digital system so she could easily fuck with our hours."

legaladvice,General Tso's Shakedown,"So I've had a bit of a problem with the owners/workers at the chinese place next to my job. I'm pretty familiar with these people because theyre in my store constantly buying all of the soda when it goes on sale. My girlfriend and I stopped in at their restaurant on monday after we left the gym, and the  owner's father was the only person working behind the counter. He doesnt speak much english and, allegedly, doesnt know how to work their card reader. I placed our order and waited for him to make and package it so we could be on our way.

I go to sign the store copy of the receipt, and i notice that our $18 and some change bill turned into $36 and some change. I brought this up to the man, figuring it was some kind of mistake, and he argues that the price is right and keeps pushing me to sign the receipt and leave. I take the receipt, and i read it before signing it and find that he's given himself a 100% tip. I point this out, and tell him im not signing anything until its fixed. He tells me that he cant change the receipt after printing it and charging my card, but after some arguing agrees to refund me what he falsely charged from the register.

Being sweaty, tired, hungry, and having been in this store for over half an hour i agree, sign the receipt, and leave thinking that would be the end of it and I'd just never give them my business again.

Well, the next day I show up at work and my coworker tells me that the people from the chinese restsurant were in there looking for me earlier. As we're having this conversation the father walks in, spots me, and makes a bee line for me to tell something. The only words i could understand from him were ""son"" and ""see"". I made the mistake of just nodding and smiling so that hed leave and i could do my job. Then they showed up the next day, telling me that i needed to go over and talk to the son/owner. And then they showed up the third day, yesterday, and proceeded to argue with me while i was with customers telling me that i owed them money and that i needed to see the son or they would call the police.

Apparently theyre claiming that my card didnt charge and now they want me to pay the full $36 and give them what they refunded me. my bank statement shows that my card was successfuly charged and that the money was taken out. Its gotten to the point at my job that my manager has had to step in and kick then out twice already. 

What do i do? Is there any legal action i can take to stop them from harassing me at work?

legaladvice,Need adoption advice,"~Texas adoption advice~

I really need some advice and support right now. I have a grown ass woman trying to take my unborn baby away from me and I'm so heartbroken and depressed
So here's the situation: 
I was going to give my baby to this woman who I thought was perfect because I was not able, at the time, to take care of my baby. Me and the woman started off on a really good foot, but as time went on she started becoming really pushy and demanding. One example, is that she was pushing me to get WIC just so that she could take my card and use it for her and the baby. I would've been completely fine with this but she made it seem like she was rich and I'm barely able to feed myself every day, so maybe I'm just being overly sensitive, but I thought that was kinda selfish. She also never made a single attempt to show up to any of the baby appointments and be involved with this pregnancy. The only thing she would do is blow up my phone to make sure the baby was healthy and alive, and to make sure I wasn't backing out. She also told me that I didn't need a lawyer because she had one and whenever I decided to go ahead and get one, she got super mad and defensive because she felt like I ""didn't trust her"". This lady has honestly made me cry out of frustration and from stress so many times and even though I didn't like her, I was still going to give her my baby because I just want my baby girl to have a good life. I ignored all the red flags and warnings from friends and family because I wanted to believe this lady was the perfect choice. 
Fast forward a bit, I found out that this lady had a criminal record for assault. That's when I decided to back out of the adoption. I understand that people make mistakes but I never really got to know her because I live too far and she never felt like driving to me, and since we weren't going through an agency I got really concerned. I've never seen her house, I've never met her husband, and now I find out about her criminal past. Of course she gets mad that I backed out. She has her whole family blow up my phone and my moms phone, she impersonated a lawyer and said that I'm being charged with adoption fraud to try to scare me, and now she called CPS on me and told them that I'm a drug addict (I'm months sober now), my mom is apparently a drug dealer, and I'm homeless. So on Monday me and my mom have to go get piss tested and they're not going to close the case until after the baby is born and I can prove I have a safe place for me and the baby. 
This is so stressful and I don't even know what to do anymore. I'm scared that if I keep my baby, she's just going to keep calling CPS and making my life a living hell. I'm so depressed."
legaladvice,Job offer withdrawn potentially leaving me unemployed. Legal options? [Uk],"Hi [r/Jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs/)!

I'm in the process of moving cities so I have been looking for a position within Manchester. I had a job interview &amp; it was discussed why I left previous positions (one of them being dismissal for performance related reasons).

A week later I received a conditional job offer presuming I passed reference checks etc. I handed my notice into my current position once I heard the news so they could fill my position, because, common courtesy. Also filled in the reference form, which I clearly detail that I've been dismissed from a previous position.

3 Weeks down the line (one week before my final date of current employment) they ring me up &amp; state the offers been withdrawn due to a bad reference. I query this &amp; they state because I was dismissed from a previous position. I initially thought this was an admin error &amp; were framing it from the POV of me being dishonest, but since I had been 100% upfront about everything I struggled to see how this was the case. 

I proceeded to state that I told them this almost a month ago during my interview, a week before I got the offer. Knowing whether you can offer someone a job that's been dismissed within the past 2 years is fairly page 1 stuff to know at interview stage. 

Whilst this was all very infuriating, causing untold inconvenience for me, my current place of work and the 6 landlords I had agreed to meet for viewings the following day.

However I'm now potentially facing something more serious as my current employer can't guarantee that they can pull my resignation as they may have already filled my position (it'll need to go through the OM on Monday). My performance has been otherwise fine/great (especially considering my notice has been handed in and this is often where people slack) &amp; this would be the only reason why they can't pull the resignation.

If the worse case scenario occurs that they can't retract it, Do I have any legal recourse for this vs the Manchester company? Due to the following

\-Wont be able to claim benefits due to me technically voluntarily leaving work.

\-Losing my job over this.

\-Weakening my job search position, as it's much easier to be employed.

\-Them having ALL the information required to make this decision prior to the conditional offer being made. 

\-This literally being how people become homeless.

Due to gross incompetence on their end potentially causing the above, where would this leave me legally speaking? Not in the sense of getting the Manchester job (as for me that ship has sailed, but in the sense of loss of earnings etc).

Also, they are an Insurance FCA regulated company, which may have it's implications."
legaladvice,Transferring probation out of state back to my hometown.,"Hey guys I just have some questions about probation transfer if anybody can help me I’ve been looking everywhere. 

I got a Minor in operation of a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (less than a DUI) in Washington where I go to school. I’m from Idaho, and I am still a resident of Idaho, and all of my family still lives there. 

Before I got this charge I was trying to transfer schools back to my hometown in Idaho, and I was wondering if probation would be able to be transferred mandatorily through the interstate compact. I satisfy all the criteria of rule 3.101 for the mandatory transfer. I’ll put them here. 

(a) has more than 90 calendar days or an indefinite period of supervision remaining at the time the sending state transmits the transfer request; and

(b) has a valid plan of supervision; and

(c) is in substantial compliance with the terms of supervision in the sending state; and

(d) is a resident of the receiving state; or

(e)

has resident family in the receiving state who have indicated a willingness and ability to assist as specified in the plan of supervision


Now my concern is that my probation is only a misdemeanor? From what I understand you can’t have a mandatory transfer for a misdemeanor unless you meet THESE criteria under rule 2.105:

(a) A misdemeanor offender whose sentence includes 1 year or more of supervision shall be eligible for transfer, provided that all other criteria for transfer, as specified in Rule 3.101, have been satisfied; and the instant offense includes one or more of the following—

an offense in which a person has incurred direct or threatened physical or psychological harm;

an offense that involves the use or possession of a firearm;

a 2nd or subsequent misdemeanor conviction of driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol;

a sexual offense that requires the offender to register as a sex offender in the sending state.

They key thing here is that I have gotten a second misdemeanor for drugs or alcohol. I got a DUI in Idaho 2 and a half years ago. But I got a withheld judgment on it which basically means if I go a year without violating probation the case is not entered on my record. I did that, so the DUI isn’t on my record. 

Knowing all this information can anybody give me insight on if I will be able to transfer back to my hometown?"

In addition to that, she heard someone trying to unlock her door a couple of times.
Also, several months ago, someone called her and introduced themselves as a police officer trying to contact possible eyewitnesses of a crime in the town we both study in. She now regrets it, but she got worried and told this person her info (name and address, if I remember correctly).
Obviously, there was no crime and I don't think police can just collect this sort of data unjustified.
Anyway, stalking has probably started at this point.
This is all happening in Ukraine, where police won't bother investigating something until the crime actually happens. She doesn't have connections nor money to bribe police into action.

legaladvice,Maintenance worker stomped my dad's Chichiuaua to death. Dad was not home at the time.,"My dad has...well...had a teacup Chichiuaua named Reece. She's lived in his apartment for the past 5 years. She is registered to the apartment and he pays extra for her to live there. Today, my dad was washing his cloths in the onsite apartment buildings laundry room. One of the maintenance guys was in the laundry room as well. My dad told the maintenance worker that he has been meaning to put in a maintence order because his furnace has not been working properly. The maintenance worker told him he would go check it out soon. According to my dad, the furnace is located outside of the apartment and in home maintenance cannot be done without a work order in place. 

About an hour later, my dad receives a phone call from his apartment's main office. They stated that the maintenance worker entered the home and was attacked by the dog. He claims that she bit him so, he pushed her off. The office was calling to let my dad know that Reece was not moving.

[GRAPHIC details]
My dad said the kitchen (where the maintenance worker entered) looked like a crime scene when he returned home. There was blood on the walls, the floor, the stove and the refrigerator. Reece was laying in a puddle of blood and her neck was clearly broken. 

He called the police to file a report. They took pictures. 

My questions:
Do you think he has a case? Also, the apartment complex is through the local housing authority, would this have any legal impact. 

We are not sure what steps to take. He would like to seek legal counsel but is low on funds. We are not sure which direction to take. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: 
I am located in NC.

Edit 2+: To correct spelling. I was working when i posted this and was typing quickly.

Edit: Wow! Thank you for all of the feedback. I just got off of work. I will be speaking to my dad in a bit to discuss what we will do next. I will update you all when we start moving things along. Thanks again!!!!"
legaladvice,"[WA] My ""landlord"" is lowering my time to vacate the premises, and other things...","I have lived in this dwelling/living space for a few years and paid rent every month for 2 bedrooms and a bathroom, a shared kitchen and backyard. First of all my Landlord is also my roommate. We share the kitchen and general living areas. She has strict rules in her contract that she has created herself, based on the kind of person she is and who she is willing to allow to live here. An example of one of these types of rules is that dishes can't be left out in the kitchen or in any other room for more than an hour after use. Sufficed to say, I got tired of them as it was approaching the time when I was going to give my 30-day notice. The beast was unleashed, and now it is very clear why she has these kinds of weird strict rules as a part of the contract... she evicted me and gave me a 2 month time period to get out due to the holidays, so I had an extra month. In the past, she has threatened to evict me, and done multiple inspections without much time passing between them. If things are sounding strange, there is more...

She is a tax evader. She hasn't paid a single dime in taxes on my rent, and I pay it in cash. She has admitted to me that she wants it in cash for this reason.  She was giving me receipts for my rent payments, but I only have the first few receipts. I am going to request the last one from this last month as well. I was wondering if there is any legal action that can be taken against me, being the tenant of someone who is not paying their income tax on my rent money.

So for this month, what I have been guilty of is violating more of these rules in her contract, and essentially, pissing her off because her house hasn't been in perfect condition all the time as of late. I had no idea of the extent... She burst into my room unannounced and yelled in my face that I now have 3 days to get out instead of my remaining 10 days.  Can she reduce the time I have to vacate the premises? Her justification for doing so is that the original notice she gave was for more than 30 days, so she can make me leave earlier now. She is writing up a new notice that gives me 3 days. Can I ask for a week's worth of my rent back? 

I started doing a little research and I found:

*"" Notice Requirements for Violating the Lease Agreement*

 *If a tenant violates any portion of the lease or rental agreement, the landlord must provide the tenant with a ten-day notice. This notice must inform the tenant that the tenant has either ten days to fix the violation, if possible, or move out of the rental unit. Lease violations include subletting the apartment when subletting is prohibited, having pets when none are allowed, or parking in an unauthorized parking space.*

*If the tenant does not fix the violation within the ten days or move out of the rental unit, then the landlord can begin the eviction lawsuit (see* [*Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 59.12.030(4)*](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.12.030)*).""*

In hindsight, I really don't know enough to use this, but I thought at the time that I had found the answer I was looking for.

So I brought this information I found to her and she is now saying that I am not her tenant. She says that because this isn't an Apartment but her House, that I am a Guest here, and implying I don't have Tenant rights (such as what I presented to her). Is this true? I have found limited information on this but from my understanding, paying rent money to occupy rooms in a house still legally counts as being a tenant? I then went along with this and told her that, well in that case then, she wasn't my landlord, giving the implication/inquiring if we are now in a situation outside of the law. She then proceeded to threaten to call the police so we could ask them if I was a tenant there, insisting that I was indeed a guest. It seems like she is using the law when it is in her favor, and threatening to call the police and lying to manipulate me? Or something like this? I don't know but I backed off so I wouldn't be potentially thrown out tonight. I take the 3 days and have a place to go... though now I have to hustle like crap.

Another thing she has done is inform me that, at the end of the month, if there is dog poop still in the backyard, that she will hire someone to pick it up and take that out of my deposit. As of now, she has already asked her landscaper friend who is doing a lawn replacement and other things in the back to pick it up (when I am still living here and had no knowledge of what he was going to do or that she asked him to do this) and is charging me for it out of my deposit. Can she legally do this?

In essence, she is a Landlord who needs a tenant, and she is a roommate who wants no physical traces of another person living there visible. If things aren't spotless, and everything done exactly to her specifications, and in a timely order, it gives her anxiety which she takes as a personal attack against her and then takes it out on me in various ways. It is only recently that I have had a sort of ""screw you"" attitude about it and been doing things more my way while I am in the process of getting out. 

Sorry if there are emotional side details that don't matter so much, I am mostly interested in the legal advice. Also, thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and gives advice."

legaladvice,Phone service provider I left in November still charging me monthly,"I switched from one phone service provider to another in November, and I'm still getting charged every month because I was on auto pay. I went to the phone company that I left to tell them what was going on and they said since they can't access my account because it was shut down, they can't cancel the auto pay. They then gave me a website to go to, I went to the website and all I saw was a phone number. I called the number and they said they weren't even associated with the company and couldn't do anything about it. I went back to the phone company and they gave me a different number to call, and the person that answered said they couldn't do anything about it and my only option is to talk to my bank. I don't really want to go through the trouble of trying to get my money back or take any legal action such as sue, I just want them to stop charging me. What are my options here?

legaladvice,Where do I stand?,"Hey,

So I’m just after some advice on a predicament I’ve found myself in after 5 months.

So, the story goes.

I bought a car from a second hand dealership (UK) I part exchanged my old car, financed the new car with my bank but there was still some negative equity left over, so the dealership financed this with a different bank. They had no problems with it, I got approved, took the car and drove off. 

5 months later, I get a phone call saying there’s now an issue. I’m told I can’t have 2 finance agreements on the same car and that I must pay one of them off. (I didn’t know this couldn’t happen, neither did the salesman or the dealership) 

Now, I told the salesman that I had already financed the car and that I had withheld funds from the bank to transfer over to their account. He agrees and gets me the details and I transfer it over. I also paid £1000 of my own money towards this. 

So I had £2000 roughly left, which he set up the finance, talked to his boss about it and it all got approved. We both signed the paper work and the deal was done.

Now they’re pressuring me into paying £4265 immediately, or they’re getting the authority’s involved. 

I just want to know if I have a leg to stand on, am I in the wrong or am I completely in the right and they’ve messed up and they’re trying to force me into paying for their mistake?"

legaladvice,Can my ex get child support from me when I have primary custody?,"My ex and I split up last year. We were unmarried and have a 2 year old child together. After the split we agreed that I would take primary custody of our son with a split if 4 days with me and 3 days with her. This was agreed very quickly between us because I am much better with our son. My ex has never been very patient person and is not good with kids. When we split we also agreed we would not do child support and we would just cover expenses for when each of us have our son and that any overlapping ot major expenses we would split with me paying 2/3 and her paying 1/3.  We are planning to go before a mediator to make everything official and avoid going to court. 

The issue comes now. My ex has just changed her mind and wants to come after me for child support. We live in Massachusetts and I make about 40k/year, she makes about 15k per year between work and child support from her ex before me. Even though I have primary custody and have our son 4 days to her 3, can she still get me for child support?

legaladvice,I was sold a 2013 Subaru Outback from a dealership and my VIN number was part of a civil suit due to a faulty engine. It just died after 1 month of ownership. What recourse do I have? (Michigan),"In December, I purchased a 2013 Subaru Outback from a local dealership. Yesterday I was driving from Grand Rapids to Detroit and after getting off of the highway, the car completely stalled and once I got it running again, almost all engine lights turned on. I got it to a mechanic in Ann Arbor and they informed me that my VIN had/has a known issue of burning oil. They informed me that the car is not leaking oil at all. I was told I need a new engine and could even drive the car back home, so I had to tow it.

Here are some links regarding the civil suit:

I am 1000 miles out of my dealerships extended warranty. This issue technically isn't a recall since Subaru settled. 

My question is would Michigan Lemon Law apply to this situation at all? 

Is the dealership at fault for selling me the defective vehicle? 

Is Subaru still at fault even though the settlement was closed in 2016?

legaladvice,"Worried that inheritance will affect daughters medical coverage with white card (Canada, NB)","My gfs father passed away around April last year, we are both common law. We have medical coverage for my 2 year old daughters type 1 diabetes through white card (social development) and myself who has prescriptions paid through it. Although we have white card we have never used financial assistance. My gf recently lost her job because of depression but has had to wait 2-3 months to even see anyone (appointment is in a week)so she got no sickleave or EI. My job was to watch my daughter technically as her illness created a part time- sometimes full time job. I will be going back to work soon but I thought in mthe mean time i would apply to get financial assistance until I get back to work.

The insurance money from inheritance is being managed by executor and majority is gone as we had to rely on it off n on since we moved into the house. We have restricted access to it but 18k left for basically legal fees and paying the executor her portion of her pay. We inherited a house worth about 45k, 100 acres of land, a car and the insurance money as mentioned above. The executor has until April to finalise everything.

I called one of  my social workers recently n when i told her about needing financial assistance she seemed rather upset. Until now I never even knew about this social workers, she setup the white card but that was it, we told other social workers about the injaritance n figured they would relay that info but this one seemed shocked.

I'm a bit concerned about what happens next. I just want the best outcome for me and my family, any advice is appreciated."

legaladvice,[Oregon] My company has been overpaying me by a lot for a long time.,"My company has been overpaying me by a lot, for good chunk of time. This is a \*very\* sizable amount of money which I have every intention of repaying.

I just noticed this problem. Should I have noticed this waaaaaaaaaay sooner? Yes. However, in my defense, I have very severe depression and wasn't feeling motivated to pay attention to my finances. I also recently learned that I'm a \*massive\* idiot. Lesson learned, I am now motivated.

That being said, they are equally responsible. I won't go into the reasons here as it will identify me to my employer (at least). But suffice it to say, every single pay period there was a \*MASSIVE\* red flag for them saying ""something is majorly wrong here"". They also changed something which caused this to happen, and they made that change without telling me.

I plan on going to a CPA to discuss all the ramifications of this. I'm pretty sure I'll need one to un-fuck myself.

I was curious what legal aspects/ramifications are to this if any.

* What are my rights in this situation?
* Is this something they could take me to court over?
* Is a repayment plan something I should be able to negotiate with the company myself?
   * I don't really know how this would work. Wage garnishment? Something else?
* I plan on finding another job in a year or so as my wife wants to move to another state (and I expect I will still be paying my company back at that point), is there anything I have to concern myself with for this?
* Anything else I should know?

legaladvice,My employer is making an application for me to work in a separate school without my permission,"I  work in a small language school in Italy. As far as the workload and the job in general go, it's fine. We were only given a contract 2 months into working here and, even then, there are shady contract practices on  the part of our employer regarding how we are paid in way in which they  can avoid tax.

The issue at hand, however, is that on top of my work at the school, which was advertised as teaching students of the language school in classes no larger than 8  students, my employer is trying to make me work teaching a local middle school teaching classes of 20 students, none of whom are part of the  language school I teach at. This was never given in the job description  and they have mentioned that it would require an application to be made  to work there.

Is it within my  rights to decline this work? It is not as the job was described to me and, to be honest, if it were, I would not have taken the job as it isn't what I'm looking to get out of this experience.

If  this is a matter of what is or is not in my contract, I would be happy  to post the contract as it is, but I get the feeling that creating a second, external application (especially without my permission, as it seems is happening at present) is not something I should have to go along with. I should say as well that they have made no mention of CRB checks or anything of the like.

My aunt and cousins thought I could help since I'm a therapist and Susie and I have a good relationship.

No money had exchanged hands as of yet and no work was performed, just plans for the upcoming race. 
When I told him that I didn’t do hookups, I would not be having sex with him to get the job, etc, I said just forget about the event with me. I would not be doing it. 
It was there that I felt discouraged with racing and posted a Facebook status the next day after giving him an opportunity the next morning to text me and apologize. He didn’t. 
I called him out on the Facebook status saying this is what happened to me. A few hours later he got wind of the post (we are not Facebook friends) and told me off via text.

legaladvice,"[MA] Bought a House Last Year, Separated, Ex Lawyered Up","**Problem:**

&amp;nbsp;

I bought a house with with my ex-significant other late last year. We broke up and said ex-SO wants nothing to do with the house. Ex-SO has retained lawyers who have demanded I choose from one of the following:

&amp;nbsp;

* A) Pay ex-SO's portion of closing costs (about $20k) and refinance the house (costing about $40k according to mortgager estimation), with a side threat of ""we think we can get more than $20k in court, so don't even think about it.""
* B) They will file a Petition to Partition (MGL c. 241 s. 7) and have a Commissioner sell the property without my consent.
* C) Agree to sell the property.

&amp;nbsp;

I cannot afford to pay this individual $20,000. I cannot afford the closing costs of a refinance. The loan is not assumable and not eligible for a cash-out refinance. I cannot afford a lawyer. I have never had luck convincing any lawyer to represent me pro bono either. I'm just a regular guy. I make less than $60,000 a year, have kids, student loan debt, credit card debt, and just get by. This person convinced me to go in on this house that was twice the cost I had was looking for originally.

&amp;nbsp;

**Miscellaneous details that may be relevant:**

&amp;nbsp;

-We have not even begun to pay the mortgage and owe more than the house is valued (although it has not been appraised since purchase).
-I have done a few thousand dollars worth of repairs/improvement (insulating and renovating garage, running new wiring, general repairs), whereas ex-SO has not. Not sure if that's meaningful if not reflected in an appraisal(?), but it feels like I'm losing out here.

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions:**

&amp;nbsp;

* Firstly, does ex-SO even have any claim on option A? I also paid closing costs at the end of the purchase.
* Secondly, is the threat of option B even legitimate? Can the property be sold without my consent because one party says so, or is this simply posturing?
* Thirdly, I don't have any place to go and I have children who live with me and go to school here. I get that option C seems like the logical route, but I just don't have any interim resources. As such, is it reasonable to fight this, or is C my *ONLY* option?

legaladvice,"I have a lifetime restraining order (filed in 2016) against my abusive ex. He hasn't contacted me since then, but he has started sending abusive messages again. What can I do?","I had to get a restraining order against my ex for mental and physical abuse. 

He's a classic abuser who will reach out under seemingly harmless circumstances, but I never respond and I block him. Be it via social media, phone numbers, or by email. When I don't respond, he becomes irate and lashes out against me. I have not responded to or acknowledged any of his messages since 2015, but I have documented each and every time he has tried to reach out. 

I want this to stop. I thought my lifetime restraining order from 2016 would suffice, but I don't know where he currently is to be able to tell the authorities. Is there any sort of recourse I can take?

I am in Texas if this helps, and the restraining order was filed and executed in a different county than the one in which I currently reside."
legaladvice,Child Support,"My father owes me over $20K in child support over the years. He has paid $50 all in all (lol). Apparently he's going to die from lung cancer. What happens to the debt he owes me when he dies?

Now, I live in Ohio and he moved to California about sixteen years ago. Again, he's only made one payment one time of $50. He doesn't have any family out there except for my brother (who he had with a woman other than my mother), and to the best of my knowledge he doesn't have any assets other than maybe a car. When he dies, does the debt just vanish, or am I going to receive the money he owes somehow?

I'm trying to go to college, so I could absolutely use it. I have to work full-time as well as go to school full-time to pay for my classes/car/insurance stuff, which is incredibly difficult and taxing on my health.

EDIT: I am aware the money goes to the person who raised me. Mother Dearest was always willing to give me any support he paid to I suppose help cushion the complete lack of support in any other way from him."

legaladvice,I tried to leave my boyfriend but he threatened me,"Im in Canada....and I’m extremely torn right now and I need some advice. Ive been living with my boyfriend because of family issues (since November 2019) and it’s been a rollercoaster. He can be very sweet, funny and generous, but he has bad anger issues. He has a tendency to swear at me, slam doors and yell. The crazy thing is half an hour later he’ll be fine and it’s exhausting. He’s talking to other women on tinder and he told me he’s not a one woman type guy (he told me that after I moved in with him). I made it clear I’m monogamous and the ironic thing is he’s extremely jealous (made me delete my tumblr because he didn’t want men talking to me). He says I’m a terrible homemaker (even tho I try to cook and I clean the entire house). He doesn’t want me to go to university or get an actual job.

A few days ago I tried to break up with him and it was a complete nightmare. He was yelling like a madman and saying awful things about me. He told me that he was going to tell his entire family that I was a “cam girl” and that’s why he broke up with me (even tho I was ending it). He threatened to drive over to my abusive Muslim families house and expose me (that I’m not a virgin etc). Even though I did tell him if my dad found out he would hurt me. He threatened to go to the police and tear my family apart. He said he was going to make my life a living hell. He said I was betraying him, I’m a liar and I’m scum. I so scared and overwhelmed that I gave up and now I’m still with him.

legaladvice,"Wife was in a hit'n'run accident, police gave the other party tickets and say he was at fault and agree with us, but his insurance and my insurance say we were at fault.","So my wife works for Papa John's as a delivery driver.

She followed him to get his license plate and other information if he would stop, and at one point he basically tried to play ""chicken"" with her in a neighborhood.

She was on the phone with the police the whole time, even during the ""chicken"" incident, and gave the police the license plate. After that incident, she finally stopped following him once they got the license plate, and she spoke to an officer in person.

While speaking to the officer in person, they caught him, gave him two tickets (One for ""Fleeing the scene of an accident in which property damage occurred"" and one for ""Failure to maintain a single lane of traffic"")

I didn't know he got the tickets, and then a few days ago his insurance told my insurance that she was at fault for ""Failure to maintain a single lane of traffic"" (THIS IS BEFORE I KNEW HE GOT THE TICKETS)

legaladvice,Boss came to my moms house to make sure she is really sick. Is this legal?,"My mom works a long term state based office job. She has been out of work all week extremely ill. She has been to the doctor three out of the last five days. She had been developing new symptoms daily and is teetering on the edge of needing to go to the hospital or not. She has gotten doctors notes on each visit.

Midweek she was informed by her boss that she needed a DETAILED doctors note upon her return. Her doctor said outlining her condition on a note is illegal, and that it is illegal of the workplace to ask, and she wrote her number on the note for the job to contact her if need be and that she would reiterate, demanding details is illegal.

Today my mother had yet another appt as even MORE symptoms appeared. She was not able to return to work as was expected. Her boss and her bosses boss CAME TO HER HOME to check on her.

My father met them at the door and told them she was resting and unavailable and he would pass along their concern. They maintained that they were there out of concern for her, but I don’t buy it.

Over the last several months this boss has begun a campaign against my mother. She has been coming up with stupid reasons to discipline her, based on rumors and complaints with no proof, including writing her up for these ghost complaints, and warned that her job was in jeopardy. This boss is new, my mom has held her position for SEVENTEEN YEARS. She is three years from retiring with a pension. I would be honest if I felt my mom was screwing up but I know she isn’t like that. She is meticulous with her job and has until now with this new boss been well liked and respected for her knowledge and experience.

I want to help advise my mother how to protect herself here. I told her she should document via email that her boss and bosses boss came to her home, as I feel that is unacceptable, invasive, and I don’t know if it’s even legal? I told her she should also inform her union rep this happened. What else can she do to protect herself?

in my opinion, her boss has been looking for a reason to fire her and I fear they are attempting to use this health crisis as an opportunity to do so."
legaladvice,Leasing month to month. Received notice of foreclosure &amp; that I need to be out in 7 days into the Alaskan winter.

If I do not vacate within 7 days (5 of the time I have seen the notice, today) - a lawsuit may be filed against me for rental value, costs, etc.

My understanding from  [http://www.law.alaska.gov/pdf/consumer/LandlordTenant\_web.pdf](http://www.law.alaska.gov/pdf/consumer/LandlordTenant_web.pdf)  is that the PTFA provides federal protections for 90 days from notice.  My lease is month to month, but:

My questions are:

1. Does my interpretation of the PTFA seem correct and applicable?
2. Any pointers for what to say on the phone?
3. Should I send a registered letter of some kind?

legaladvice,Need Advice on Amazon's Refund Policy (UK),"Hi there,

Amazon sent me the wrong item on a recent order, and it's currently on its way back to their returns address. I've experienced an issue today when speaking with Amazon support regarding the value of my refund. I'll break it down simply.

My order included 2 items. Item 1 was £358.98, and item 2 was £49.99. I am returning Item 1 for a full refund.

I paid for this order with a mix of credit card and a £40 gift balance from my account. As the gift balance took off £40, I paid £368.98 on my credit card. Due to this, the total value of the refund due is more than covered by the payment made on my credit card.

I asked Amazon to assure me that the refund would be made entirely to the credit card, as I have no interest in a small amount of gift balance. They told me that the gift balance is automatically split between items when ordering, and that the refund would be provided by both credit refund and gift balance. However, they couldn't say exactly how much. Apparently, it could be £39.99 gift balance, or £5. Who knows? Not them, apparently.

I argued this, of course, stating that my card covered enough for the refund, but the customer service rep said that refunds are all done by the system and nothing can be done about it. 

I work for a large online retailer, and we will ALWAYS refund real payment methods before any digital/gift balances. In this exact instance, the full amount would be refunded to card without a second thought.

Do I have any legal stance to demand the full refund to my credit card? As far as I can see, Amazon are just picking and choosing what amount they get to keep, based on a system that we have no way of seeing. What do you guys think?

Thanks in advance!"
legaladvice,Credit Reporting Mess,"Hello everyone. I needed some advice as I’m stuck in a situation I’m unsure of how to solve, I’ll try to keep it short.

**backstory**

Had a car loan with Westlake Financial Services that I was eventually unable to pay due to job loss several years ago. They repossessed the vehicle, charged off the debt, then sold it to a third party. 

**dealing with third party**

The company that purchased the debt went out of business and ended up selling it to another third party: Capital Link Management, sometime in 2019.

I settled with CLM in October of 2019 and expected that the debt would be updated on my credit report to show as paid off, or possibly removed. 

**current problem**

When the report was never updated I started to call around, submit disputes to the reporting agencies and so on. But every time I dispute the validity of the Westlake account on my credit report the agencies always come back saying the information is verified as accurate. I’ve provided them with payment receipts but apparently that doesn’t work because all they do is send that information to Westlake, who ultimately makes the decision regarding validity. 

The thing that concerns me is that Westlake does not own the debt and should not have any say or involvement in this matter. They have admitted to me multiple times that they do not own the debt. 

I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard place because Westlake won’t fix the report, and CLM won’t report it on their end because I paid them quickly before they got the chance to report. At this time, they have no incentive to report a settled account.

With all of that said, is there any way to force one of these three entities (Westlake, CLM, credit reporting agencies) to fix this?

The information on my report is not accurate and dealing with these parties is becoming a headache.

legaladvice,[California] Irvine Landlord states email notice was not valid. Demands extra rent.,"Hello,

I've tried to research this on my own, but I've been unable to find a clear answer. Many sights suggest not emailing the landlord, but many others state there isn't precedence. I haven't seen anything that flat out states it is unacceptable.

Below are the details. Any advice would be appreciated.

My lease is expiring on 02/18. On 01/13 I sent an email (from my official registered email) to the business office of my apartment that said:

&gt;Hello,  
&gt;  
&gt;I have enjoyed my time at \[redacted\], but after seeing the proposed renewal rates I began shopping for alternatives and have decided that my unit is not worth the new rate of \[redacted\] to me as I can find multiple options that are more appealing to me in that price range.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I will not be renewing after my lease expires on February 18th.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you,

I was called by them on the following day (01/14) at which time they left a voicemail telling me that the email was received. They didn't raise any concerns so I assumed everything was fine.

Then on January 22nd I was contacted again and told that I must fill it out a specific form in order to be in compliance with California law. Furthermore I would be responsible for a full 30 days of rent from the day I turned it in (January 23rd). My lease merely states that I must give written notice 30 days in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Upon expiration of the Lease, but not upon the earlier termination thereof, the tenancy shall automatically continue from month to month unless: (i) Landlord gives Resident written notice of Landlord’s intent to terminate the tenancy in accordance with California Civil Code 1946.1; (ii) Resident gives Landlord written notice at least (30) days prior to the Lease End Date of Resident’s intent to terminate the tenancy; or (iii) Landlord gives Resident any other termination notice allowed by law. In the event the tenancy continues on a month to month basis, the terms and conditions of the Lease shall apply, except Landlord may increase the Rent or otherwise change the terms of tenancy as allowed by law.

Based on the spirit of the law and what I have read, this seems like they're merely trying to bully me into paying an extra $600, but maybe I'm missing something."
legaladvice,Boss says she wont pay me based on GA laws?,"Hi everyone one! 
I worked for a woman for about 2 months doing retail work in her store, where I was the only employee. She only paid me for a week of work every 3 weeks during my time there which created a backlog where I was still owed for a full months pay. I quit without notice. She closed the store within a week of me quitting. 
By december 31 she had still not paid me for the whole month of November and when asked about it originally she said that she lost too much revenue to pay. Today when I asked again about my unpaid wages she said she had not been clear the first time and deducted the money she lost from the store closing from my wages since I didnt give a notice and that Georgia State law allows her to do this. 
I have contacted the GA department of labor for clarification but they have been particularly bad about getting back to me!

My GF's older sister has never lived with us, and is always in legal trouble (theft, drugs). Lately the local Sheriff's department has been coming by our place looking for her. We have told them that she doesn't and never has lived here and that we are not in contact with her. The Sheriff told us that our address is the address listed on her driver's licence. I called the local city police department about it as maybe false identity or something and they said that the only thing we can do is call the DMV and talk to them about it. But when calling the DMV they say that that is private information and can't discuss it with us. That they only discuss it with the older sister, who won't change it as she is obviously using it to evade the police. Is there anything else we can do to get this taken off her driver's licence? It's incredibly annoying hearing a knock on the door and wondering if its the police looking for her. Also I am concerned if she can use our address to steal our mail or other things as she has also been arrested many times for Identity Theft."
legaladvice,Need help registering a dropshipping business (Kansas),"Little bit of background: I'm a 20 year old college student with no idea how to file taxes, register a business, etc. A group of friends and I decided to design t-shirts and sell them online to our friends and followers, and since I designed the shirts I'm in charge of running the online marketplace and print-on-demand service.

Not sure whether this detail is important or not, but when I set up the online store I have the option between only allowing people with the link to find my store or putting it in the marketplace. 

I'm ready open my online shop for business, but I'm really confused about a lot of things. I don't know what type of business I'd be considered (if any), whether I need to register my business or not on a state or federal level, or how to do so in the first place. 

Finally: Since this is for charity and our profit margins will be on the lower end of the spectrum and (I think) we'd have to pay income tax on top of that, if there were some way around having to register as a business or any way I could reduce any expenses in this whole process I would jump at the opportunity. Obviously, only if it were legal, but the more we can raise for charity the better!

legaladvice,"I dropped 6k on a used car at a dealership. Five days later, I find out it’s a lemon. Dealer won’t let me back out.","I’m going to try to keep this as brief as possible.
So, I bought a 2009 Subaru Outback from a used car dealership. They told gave me the usual sweet talk and I signed as As Is.


I have it delivered the next day and drive it to and from work the next few days. The Tire Pressure light pops on and something feels a little off with the steering, but no big deal, I probably just need to air up my tires. The airbag light is on and -like a dummy, I just think it means that they are on.


Five days after I purchase the car I finally have a day off. I can’t wait to take her out on a real drive!
Thirty minutes into the drive and, in addition to those first two lights, the cruise control starts flashing, the check engine light comes on, and the anti lock brake light comes on.


I take it back to the dealership and they said they’d check her out. They call the next day and tell me it’s just an oil sensor.


I google the symptoms for that and my car didn’t display any of them.


They “fix” it and I come to pick it up. The airbag light and tire pressure light is still on.


I’m suspicious, so I take it to my mechanic.
Here is a list of things he found:


-Needs front breaks

-R/S Head Gasket leaking coolant externally

-L/S Gasket peaking Oil

-Oil Pan Leaking

-Left drive Axel Boot Split Open

-Two engine mounts and trans mounts broken

-Lower Control arm bushing worn out

-Battery test poor

-ABS light on- steering sensor problem

-R/S Airbag open circuit
 
-TPMs no sensor activity detected.

Now, when I signed As Is, I was not aware of any of this.
I took this list to them and they said that with a car with high mileage (172k) it’s bound to have issues and that I’m just having buyers remorse.
They said the would “donate the cost of labor” to fix “some” of these issues.


Is that the best I’m going to get? Do I have any ground to stand on right here? I live in Arizona, if that’s useful.

legaladvice,"Adverse Possession issue, not sure where to go from here.","Hi, I have a bit of a convoluted issue, not a ton of money to spend on attorneys if it can be avoided, and I have no clue where to even start.

So, the long and short of it is; I thought I was buying a house Lease Option To Buy about 7 years ago. I moved in and thus began an odd landlord/lien holder and tenant situation. After being here a while, things just started going horribly awry. I found out when he did ""home improvements"", he didn't do anything by the books. No permits were pulled and nothing was done right. He knew he screwed up those improvements, that there was significant damage and black mold that he hid, thus why he chose to sell his house the way he did - to avoid the normal closing proceedings I guess.

So, when I discovered the issues, I contacted him to get them repaired. His reply was that it was technically my house now, and  that he wouldn't deduct repairs from the rent/payment. That seemed shady since it was a direct result of his negligence, but what could I do? Things just kept getting worse, and while this may be my first time buying a house, I'm decent at researching solutions.

My first course of action was to threaten to file a Warranty of Habitability. But then I got nervous that the house may be condemned and I would lose everything I put into it. So I contacted an attorney who took Mold cases on a contingency basis. She sent in her environmental guy, and apparently it was worse than what I was aware of at that point. She seemed excited for the case, and contacted him to discuss settlement, insurance or lawsuit options.

Since I'm writing this now, you can tell it didn't go well. According to her, he was ""Judgment Proof"" and I was about to get some more unpleasant news; He hadn't paid property taxes and sewage fees in YEARS (he hadn't paid for years prior to me taking over, and still didn't while I was there, nor did he notify me so I could pay). How she found out the taxes were past due before me, I don't know. She was nice enough to point me in the right direction from there, but I am unsure of how to file the forms, or even what forms I need, etc.

Her advice was: Since he has essentially abandoned the property for more than 5 years at this point, I'm paying all the property taxes and fees, repairs etc, that I should file for Adverse Possession to get the home fully in my name so I can do the necessary repairs without worry of him coming and swiping it out from under me. (And by necessary repairs, I mean having the house demolished and starting over. The land is worth a decent chunk of change, but because of everything he did to the house, the house itself is worthless. Walls have crumbled, pipes have burst, wiring was done wrong and my gas fireplace is fucking hooked up to my gas heater some how. He was definitely no Tim Allen.)

So, I guess my question now is -  how do I file for Adverse Possession, are there specific forms and procedures? He took off, I have no clue where he is or how to reach him. (he moved to another state to escape some other legal issues unrelated to this or me)

Thanks for any advice and I apologize for the length!

legaladvice,Company vice president announced an upcoming drug test I'm not sure is legal [MN],"Hey reddit!

I live and work Minnesota. I'm here because I think my employer might be about to require a drug test that doesn't follow the state laws governing when/who can be required to take a drug test by their employer, and if theres anything I can do if it is not.

Recently, the VP of the company stormed into my department during our morning meeting to angrily announce a drug test. He told us was he was ""really mad and couldn't believe what was going on out on the floor during working hours"" but did not elaborate what was going on. He then told us he was going to ""drug test this department and two others next month, so if you can't or won't pass then it's time to find a new job. I can't fucking believe this."" 

And then he stormed off, saying he was going to tell all of the departments about it. 

After that I read up on my state's drug testing laws and I don't think what they're planning on doing is a legal test. From what I could tell, in MN an employer can only drug test if they have an accessible written drug testing policy, and it may only drug test current employees under certain circumstances:

1) during a routine physical examination, but cannot request or require a drug test during a physical more than once per year. 


2) if they were involved in a work related accident, injured at work, injured another person at work, got caught violating the drug/alcohol policy in some way, or were suspected of being under the influence on the clock.


3) randomly, but they may only randomly test employees who are in a designated ""safety sensitive"" position (or if they are professional athletes) and it must truly be random, with all employees subject to random testing equally likely to be chosen. 

So, none of us (in my department at least) have been involved in any work accident or injury or anything like that. And if someone was caught with drugs/alcohol at work, it seems like the only employee being tested should be the employee caught with the contraband on company property, unless I'm misinterpreting.

The company does have a written drug and alcohol testing policy. It does not include anything about a routine physical/drug test. It also doesn't specify any positions as ""safety sensitive."" I don't think my position would fall under that category, but I have no way of knowing because the term is general and could be used in many ways.

The company policy I signed on my first day has the blanket statement ""all employees are subject to random drug and alcohol testing."" But that seems weird, I'm pretty sure at the very least the accountant and front desk employees would not be considered to be in safety sensitive positions.

Besides can a test truly be considered random if they test entire specific departments and also give warning beforehand?


I don't know if the reason I want to find a way around taking the test is relevant, but I would be able to pass this drug test. I do use marijuana, but I have a current and legitimate medical marijuana certification, and I fall under the protected category of the state law surrounding medical marijuana and workplace drug tests. I only use it at home, I have never gone to work after using it, and I have never brought it on company grounds. I would prefer that the VP/CEO of the company did not
know I am a medical user. They have made their view on marijuana, including all medicinal uses, very clear in the past and I am somewhat concerned I will be targeted if they see I tested positive but they can't fire me. Hell, maybe they'd fire me anyway. 

Any guidance is appreciated, I'm not really sure what to do here. 

**tl;dr** VP of the company I work for announced they were going to drug test every employee in three specific departments next month because ""something is happening at work"" I'm wondering if the test is compliant with state law, and if it isn't what is the best method of handling it, would it be better to refuse the test citing state requirements?"

SURPRISINGLY enough the  there was a fire that NIGHT and the tenants elderly boyfriend, who was living there and wasn't on the lease, tried to put out the fire with his bare hands and feet rather than call the fire department and ended up with major 1st degree burns to his hands and feet and had to be airlifted to a hospital in another city. We don't know how the fire started, but the tenant blames it on me for a de-faulty baseboard heater that they never reported in all the years they lived there. They said they did, but the property management company told me that they never got any notifications. I've never heard of baseboard heaters just combusting like that in all my years... I went over and inspected the damages and found that it was quite minimal and would be easy to repair. My main concern is the injured individual, as he is currently in emergency but is stable. The fire department is currently investigating and we are waiting for their report. I don't know if this was intentional but the timing is suspicious in a time that they were most upset. I want to make sure I am financially safe and want to know the worse case scenario and what actions I should take. I don't know if the man would go after the management company or me, or maybe both, either way I do have insurance on the apartment/business but I am still a nervous reck."
legaladvice,[LA] What exactly happens when the apartment we're renting is sold?,"My wife and I have been living in an apartment (half of a duplex) for the past eight months, and we've just been informed that someone has put down a down payment on the duplex and it's ""pending"".

We're not on a lease of any kind. We were on a lease until January, and the landlady has been 'in the process' of writing up our new lease, but she takes *forever* to do anything despite constant reminders (for example, there's a hole in the floor we were promised would be fixed when we first moved in, never happened, our old lease said a landscaper would come every weekend and I believe he came twice in eight months, we're supposed to have internet and AC as per the old lease and we got neither, you get the idea), so I'm worried about what will happen to us when the sale goes through and we're not on a lease.

At what point do we stop paying the landlady? Whose job is it to tell us who bought the duplex? Do we pay rent to the new owners or do they have the right to force us out of our apartment?

I've never been in a situation like this and the landlady hasn't been communicating with us at all. I've spoken with the tenant on the other side and he's also been asking the landlady for some kind of lease agreement (he's been here about six months) and she keeps telling him she'll get around to it but hasn't."

legaladvice,"Was given a voluntary witness statement from to fill out, do I have to?","I'm in Iowa, and this happened recently. Basically,  I tried helping this guy out whose car ran out of gas by giving him a ride to a gas station.

Police car drove by as we started leaving, leaving his car where it was.

He urged me to go because he didn't have a license. I didn't think and went.

Police pulled me over, and he suddenly had his license. 

Turns out he was drunk, and he also claimed to have taken pills to try and hurt himself. While the cop wasn't present he told me he only said that to avoid being arrested. 

I told the police this, an ambulance showed up to take him and I was let go. The police said I wasn't in trouble and thanked me. Gave me a voluntary witness statement to fill out,  and I left.

Do I have to fill it out and turn it in? Am I at risk of legal action if I do?"
legaladvice,"(TN) - (FL) Need help, at wits end","I just have to get right into the thick of it, for anything to make sense. It's over our heads and we have been left stunned and don't know where to turn.

December 6th at two am we received a call from our son in Tennessee, he had just found out his sister, our youngest daughter. Had been murdered along with her very recently married husband, I have to mention my daughter was indeed 7 months pregnant with his daughter, however had two children from a previous relationship.

We were devastated, to say the least. We were not in a position to up leave Maine to run down there. So we made some calls to find out where our other two grandchildren were. At that time we were told ""protective custody"" well enough, I mean at that point there killer was still on the loose, so it was an acceptable answer, since they did witness the who thing, as we found out recently.

4 days later we arrived in Tennessee, in dealing with our daughters funeral arrangements and id'ing her body. We found out they had them captured the killer he was behind bars. And we began to obtain contact with our grandchildren again. Again we are told ""protective custody"" nobody in the state Dept returns calls. We were utterly in the dark for two weeks while there.

Month later we find out we can file for custody from Maine, we drive back to Tennessee and do so. Still are blocked from seeing our own grandchildren.

Two months later we already in court, our son and eldest daughter are also going for custody, out there petitions behind ours. We go into court unified. The natural father suddenly wants custody, a violent psychopath excessive drug user, with a mighty lengthy police record, we were not to concerned. But procedure is procedure, he was ordered to do a few things and we would reconvene in two months.

Back to Tennessee for court, bio dad accomplishes nothing he was ordered. Judge gives another chance then he is out. ""Bear in mind we still have not seen either grandchild and now 5 months have gone by"" their ages are 7-5.

Two months later ""this is getting expensive, funeral, lawyer and now travel expenses 2 day trip stay a night or two in Tennessee then back 2 days. I'm a wreck in sales drowning due to the grief and can't afford to grieve"" we tough it out digging deeper each time. He still has not accomplishes a thing, very well judge orders ICPC finally, we start that process being told ""they cannot by law make you suffer for the time it takes to complete ICPC. We hold our heads high. Were clean very clean, having never even had a parking ticket and barely even drink. But these things take FOREVER, 6 months and that was a rush and an exemplary job on the state of Maine's behalf, everyone we dealt with were just wonderful caring and involved.

6 months ICPC is complete have our KINSHIP Foster licence in hand heading back to Tennessee, to arrive at court and hear that the ""Foster mother AKA step Aunt, we just now find out"" has had them all along, now suddenly she wants custody, saying she is the blood Aunt of the little girl who is 4, we knew she wasn't and she damned well knew, but it was a stall, at that point WE paid for the bloodwork with bio dad, this was indeed one of the things he was ordered to do all along.

Back down two months later with results that we knew, yep negative. But now she makes the claim, it's been so long anyway Tennessee should just leave them with her, and apparently the therapists have a claim that the children don't even know who we are, though not even a year before this happened, they literally lived with us until they got a place of their own, 8 months before prior to December 6 2017 they had just moved back to Tennessee. And we're told at that point we are now on shaky ground but still a chance, judge wants then on video calls with us via the therapists start reintroducing the grandparents.

In the following three months we got a total of three video calls, first one we h thought went very well and we thought proved they knew us, as when the camera went on they both yelled our names, called both dogs by name even, next two were enchanting but lackluster and distracted.

Back to court step Aunt has full backing of the therapists, they're report is damaging, they still are enforcing the claim the kids have no idea who we are, with a line in about ""the kids thought they were nice and would like to meet them"" but were not sure who they were.

So little explanation waiting in the hall to court, we were there an hour early as usual. When therapist one wlks in she hardly even acknowledged us, second one comes in gives us a broken smile and a pinkie wave, and then the ""Foster mom"" comes in and by Stark contrast, one jumps up yells her name runs over and hugs her, the other was nearly the same, big hugs stand around giggling, I shit you not. We knew right then we were done for, but hoped the judge would see through it, he kinda known for bucking the system.

Not today, nobody dares stand up to the therapists, nobody wants to take blame if something went wrong handing them over to us, our lawyer even mentions how much the DCS attorney is personally against what they are about to do, but DCS has no choice but to follow the therapists.

Custody is granted to the""Foster mom/step Aunt"" and we are backed over a barrel, it almost seemed out lawyer is now working for them, it was strange. This is what we were told.

Agree to make her an Aunt in paper and you will have visitation, now it can't legally supercede an adoption, but if you play she will play, if not she will not allow visitation, and you loose everything. Well of course we agreed in order to see our grandchildren, we had to make a woman, who's own brother despised and our daughter didn't care for.

FF a year of visits, little one wet the bed profusely, first time, we picked them up were handed a big bag of pullups, told she was a heavy bed wetter, not once did we use then nor had to, she never wet, not once in the month at the house. The grandson we were told has terrible nightmares every night, be ready to run to his aid and keep him in the bed with us to console him. Again not once did he have a nightmares, when we asked about the nightmares his response was pure and simple, I like it here with you Nana.

As the visits went on we correct one issue at a time, not through discipline, but love and understanding, giving them the one on one they so badly need, poor babies saw momma and stepdad murdered and then sat in the house for nearly two days with the bodies before discovered.

The last visit nearly traumatized us, the little one in chasing the cat knocked over a picture. She then ran into her room crying in hysterics hiding under her bed, when I went into the bedroom she was apologising profusely/crying and asking me not to spank her, something is very very wrong with that picture.

Grandson on last visit in bringing him back begged us not to, curled up in the back seat crying he didn't wanna go back there, we find out a few days later he was actually so upset about it he was throwing up all night.

Were trying to reopen the case, our lawyer is reluctant says it may likely go nowhere, were so deeply invested at this point we just can't afford another lawyer. Everything we read in both federal and Tennessee state law says we can just adopt them, then our lawyer says no.

I'm bringing this here out of sheer frustration, I can see clearly that not only has this family been wronged by the state, but they have effectively introduced a second level of trauma, they have 2 other aunt's and an uncle with children, who we can prove were together constantly, and now are not even allowed to see their own blood cousins 8 to be precise.

Were looking in every direction and Everytime were pretty well shot down, everyone involved save the therapists and Foster parent is in shock, makes no sense, but here we are.

What could we be missing ?

EDIT : (6 Months ago we moved to Florida, largely to be closer to the grandchildren, and not have to suffer the extreme weather traveling to get them for visits.)"

legaladvice,Mother didn't receive Court Summons (NJ),"My mother recently married and moved, and the probation officer my father had his request ordered through delivered the summons to the wrong address.

We learned today that the date of summons was yesterday and she has missed it.

What are her options to minimize damage here? She had married and moved away and has been registered at this new address for some time now.

I know her voting records have been updated as well because those forms have landed at this house as well.

For the curious and the fact that it may be relevant the summons had to do with an amended restraining order that was filed in court when my brother and I were young children. My mother says ""he said that you weren't safe with me because people were coming after you"" or something along those lines.

I should preface this next part by the fact that my father is a paranoid schizophrenic and has been criminally institutionalized following an event I'll explain.

The usual custody issues ensued. I remember missing him and going to the court house for visitation pretty regularly until he stopped showing up.

Years later the only thing I hear about him was he flipped a man over his back in an acme and it was all over the news.

They found him living in his truck out in the woods and he must have resisted arrest because I remember his beat up face in the newspaper.

Eventually when I had turned 18 he had put a request in and my brother and I were given a choice by the judge at the time to either continue with the original order or amend it having us removed. My brother who is a little older than me but also a paranoid schizophrenic had agreed to remove himself but I did not. 

It's been some time now and my father is trying again, but my mother was never served the summons.

I guess because she's the plaintiff in the original order even though it was court ordered (so I'm told) she was given the summons. I'm assuming I need to show up to court if/when a new court date is provided.

I don't want my mom to have to deal with this any longer.

Personally I don't want to have to deal with this any longer either."

I live in NSW, Australia, with my Mother. Recently (1-2weeks ago), our neighbours have decided to sell their house. During this period, they've been living with their parents up in Sydney which is roughly 2-3 hrs from here. Until Thursday (3 days from writing this post), one of the neighbours had been actively staying there to tend to the house's needs and, presumably, feed the cat which they haven't taken as of yet (though have stated that they plan to once they find a new house).
Presently, the owners of the cat have been absent for three days, meaning that they have not fed it, nor have they ensured that a clean supply of water is available to the animal- From what I've read online, this would be a violation of animal laws in NSW, Australia, but instead of taking it to the local vet like I suggested, my Mother has insisted that we keep it as ""they're not looking after &lt;insert cat's name&gt;"", and, should they stop by asking the location of the animal, has stated that we'll just hide it. 
She's only just made this decision an hour ago, but I'm nervous that this has a worser outcome for her than it does if she chooses to take it the vets.
Neighbour's do not have a lot of money, which I believe makes it more likely that they'll take the matter to court as they have more to gain, if she loses the case.
Also, as for evidence that they have abandoned it, we've only accounts from myself, my Mother and two of their friends, who have stated that Neighbours children terrorise the cat.
Edit: Forgot to mention that, in the past (Last 3 years), there have been multiple times in which we've fed the cat as there are nights in which the Neighbours don't return home. They're aware that we feed the cat and have not tried to deter us from doing so, instead acknowledging it and thanking us. 
Also, if it makes any difference, the cat doesn't show any signs of malnourishment whatsoever."
legaladvice,Asked to Sign NDA Prior to Business Formation,"I recently reconnected with an individual that I did contract work for. We are both based in the US. I reached out to the individual to get advice on becoming an entrepreneur. They have operated successful businesses for decades, and I do look up to them.

The conversation quickly turned into the individual pitching me a business idea and there were talks of a partnership. Without going into the details of the idea, I can say this: the product is software, the foundation will be based-off models already created by one of their current companies, they have the connections within the specific industry.

Fast forward to now. The individual emailed me an NDA their attorney compiled saying they would like me to sign it before providing me with the models, research, etc for the new product. This is between their current company and me. I do feel like I have no bargaining power because the foundation of the product is based-off their models and definitely something I have no knowledge of. My initial thoughts were that I'd be the technical co-founder of the new company/product. But the NDA has me worried...

Should I be signing an NDA prior to the formation of a new business? FYI I plan on taking the NDA to an attorney but wanted to get additional advice from this community. Thanks!"

legaladvice,Moving out of state with child,"For starters I am from California, I have a 3.5 month old and me and the father were never married and he has signed the birth certificate. 

I am due back to work within the next two weeks. Her dads mother can watch my baby twice a week but I am unable to find anyone else to watch her on the other days. Not to mention even if I did I do not have any money to pay someone for child care. That being said my mom has offered me to move in with her and my step dad in another state (850 miles away) completely rent free and my mother would be able to watch her at nights given I find a job. 

My question is do I need a court order in order to move out of state? 

Her father maybe sees her one a week for two hours if he shows up. He was in the picture her first 8 weeks and then up and left.  Out of the 15 days he was supposed to see her he has shown up maybe half. I have asked him for money for diapers and formula and get ignored each time. He doesn’t call or text to check up on her or ask for pictures and to be honest I think the once a week visit is so he doesn’t feel like a complete asshole for abandoning her. 

I am currently waiting for a court date for child support but I’m under the impression that is completely different than a custody agreement even tho we will go over how much time he spends with her.  Is this correct?

Some stuff I’ve read online says I have to inform him of the move to give us time to go over visitation or for him to proceed with a custody hearing. I have no doubt a judge would see it in my child’s best interest to move. I am just worried about being charged with kidnapping of any sort if I move suddenly. I may not have a choice if I cannot work due to not having a sitter and I cannot pay a sitter if I do not work. Therefore leaving me with no money to pay my rent, gas, food etc."

legaladvice,Landlord charging me fees for guests on AST tenancy UK,"My landlord (LL) has suddenly decided that my bf can't stay more than 2 nights and additional nights will cost same price as it would cost me if i divided my monthly rent by days of the month. So basically double the price of the room each day.

I think this is unreasonable as I am in a shared house with other tenants who pay less and have had their partners stay for a few weeks and every other day.

I have only had my bf stay for one week in total days over 3 year period. 

In my tenancy I have a clause which says: 

To use  the property as private residence  for the tenant and for all other occupiers as the landlord has expressly permitted. The tenant is not to have other lodgers or longterm guests at the property without the landlords expressed consent and is not to commit any action that would lead to the landlord being in breach in obligation regarding the licensing of the property as a House of Multiple Occupancy pursuant to part 2 of the house act 2004.

Am I in breach of contract if he stays for a week or so? What would constitute a long-term guest? If I reject LL fees what will happen and can I leave my tenancy early because this is unreasonable ( I have a 4 week notice clause). I'm really worried and looking for advise also based on below info.

Further info :
There are 2 other tenants and landlords partner (doesn't pay rent) - in a 5 bed house.
Contract ast states I'm renting whole property not a room within property. Deposit is registered and that also says I am renting a 5 bed house.
Possible fraud by LL  as my name is showing under deposit scheme for a 5 bed house and they wanted applied for remortgage with a new contract for me to sign but it was still dated the year I moved.
Other housemates would not be affected since I have an ensuite, and my food storage etc in my room. Also no shared communal space anyways. Also tiny kitchen and we would not be in the house much. I regularly travel for work so each month I am away for approximately 7-8 days a months so no it would not cost more to them if he stayed even a month. 
Bf lives abroad so he doesn't come any other time only on his holiday so I never have any overnight or day guests being that it is a bedroom and no communal area.
LL partner also suddenly staying permanently in the house and has mental issues, waking me up for last week as he is super drunk and was screaming and banging his head and running around in house around 3am. I feel scared as I am only female and he has already screamed and hsrrased another house mate who left suddenly due to him.he has also accused ms of walking in my room because he can't be bothered to fix floorboards to tenant below can hear me, that is not my problem. Made me feel like I was being harassed due to number of time he kept expecting me to agree."

However, following the maintenance, our landlord has been evasiveness, secretive, and sketchy surrounding the electric problem.

legaladvice,Septic Drain Field on Neighbor’s Commercial Property—Help Please,"This is my first post ever on Reddit, so here we go. 

My husband and I purchased our first home in March 2018 in Georgia. We are young and I now consider us dumb because we bought from an investor and agreed to no disclosure. It is located directly next to a commercial tree business. They own the land next to ours, as well as directly behind ours, thanks to a quick sale by an estate of a deceased woman. We have never had problems with them and they seem like good people. 

Our house was built in 1963 and was the first built on these few acres. It’s on a septic system and the drain field does cross into their property (unbeknownst to us until now.) There are easements recorded in place dividing some of both of our properties. 

They approached us and told us our septic system was leaking onto their property. Not backing up, but leaking. A small stream is coming out of the ground. We can’t smell it, and it’s about 150 ft from our property line (we live on half an acre, so not much land.) Typically I would have no issue with taking responsibility for my property, except for the fact that this started happening coincidentally about a week or so after they started digging back there &amp; building an additional storage building. 

We had a septic guy come out &amp; he essentially told us our drain field was failing and needed to be replaced. He said that due to lack of land in the back to replace the current field, we would have to reroute it to the front of our property. According to him, this will run us about $15k. We are both 24 years old, work full time, and have a 6 month old daughter. We do well for ourselves, but not well enough to drop $15k next week. 

My question is: Where does the liability lie in this situation? Are we responsible because it’s our drain field? Is there a way to see if they possibly damaged it during their construction? If so—would they be liable?

legaladvice,"I have fallen down an internet Rabbit hole into something I think is illegal regarding the takeover of a company. Can anyone determine if this is illegal or not, and if so what actions should be taken?","A company I invested in a while ago went fairly dark. I've been looking into them and came across this site investorhub. It seems like a pretty big site that people use for discussion on stock tickers.

On ihub, anyone can become a moderator and basically control the narrative of the board if there were no mods prior. The company I'm involved in, it seems like a small group has overtaken this board and flood it with messages portraying the company as a scam company. So far, this is all legal (it shouldn't be, due to stock shorting, but I digress)

Late last year I noticed a fake twitter made of this company, posing to be the company itself. The ihub flooders began pushing this twitter in their posts, claiming it was the legitimate twitter of the company. On the twitter account, whoever is running it is claiming new SEC filings will be out soon, etc. - this is where we start talking legality as this is now clearly impersonation involving SEC documentation

The company's website in the past day or two, seems to have been hacked and is now showing that they're in an entirely different business. When the company name is googled, it says ""website under construction"" followed by the name of a small time investment group who buys and sells shell companys. Months prior to all this, I made a fake account to merely state that the twitter they were citing wasn't legit, and someone messaged me claiming that the flooders were most likely from a specific investment group. The same group that I just mentioned I saw when I googled the company's name. When I google the fake twitter handle, one of the results links to a 200 follower twitter account from a ""company"" who happens to be in the same business that whoever took over the website is portraying the company to now be in. When I went to email the company to notify them, it said their email no longer existed, undeliverable (prob due to the takeover)

Googling more about the owner of said investment firm, he seems to be an extremely shady dude into extremely shady stuff. Multiple lawsuits, other random posts I've found of people claiming he was involved in other similar scams, etc.

After doing some research on the small investment group it seems that in the past, they have sued ihub and successfully gotten names/addresses of specific users from the court case (judge ruled that ihub had to provide them) so I'm scared to speak up on in general about it. I'm already worried that this will happen again and ihub will give them my info, as I've posted pretty slanderous stuff against this group on that board.

Anyone have any insight into this? I can provide more specifics as needed. I believe the ""imposters"" along with the legitimate company both operate in Florida"

legaladvice,Incorrect worker classification and AB5,"Hi all. I live in California and I was hired by my current employer this last October. When they brought me on they did so as an independent contractor. (BTW, I am the only worker.) I thought that was odd considering, and I did some research, I really am an employee. All signs seem to point to the fact that I am. I’ve since boiled it down to they don’t want to deal with the costs involved with having me as an employee. 

Fast forward to the beginning of the new year and they haven’t done anything about complying with the new AB5. All of a sudden my boss’s attitude has changed going from pleasant and engaging to cold and distant with the change of the new year. They went ten days without returning my texts asking when I work. Now they’ll just leave the office early for the day without a goodbye or a “see you tomorrow at nine”. Also, they won’t even pay me after my repeated requests (payday is every Friday) and I’ve only been paid once this month. 

Now the attitude thing might not have anything to do with anything, considering I like to overthink, but I almost feel like they’re trying to get rid of me via the ghosting route so that they don’t have to deal with AB5. I’m just extremely disappointed that upon my hiring they made all these promises (unfortunately verbal) of all these awesome things they had planned for me and the company. I’d like to keep my job, however I’d like to know what I can do about  1, my initial incorrect hiring classification; 2, compliance with AB5 and 3,  getting paid.

Thanks for listening. Unfortunately I’m just very upset at the whole thing and am facing the reality that people can frankly really suck after building you up so far."

She went off her mood stabilizers, slept on the floor when she had a bed for over a month, refuses to build her child’s crib or get us to help her, leaves her baby in a pack n’ play all day every day and sometimes leaves her in dirty diapers for extended periods of time..... I’ve caught her forgetting to feed her. I couldn’t tell you the last time she gave her a bath. And I’ve given her countless mommy groups, literature, pediatricians, single mother help, etc. but she won’t even browse it. I even offer to drive as she has no car.

We caught her trying to bring over a guy she knew for less than a month online to fly out and sneak him in to stay with us. (We caught on and he ended up being a psycho as well.)



We care for the child both physically and monetarily.  The child only suffers from the above when we are at work and we have set up measures including babysitters to ensure the child is ok at all times as we don’t trust her.

legaladvice,Do I have a case against the seller of my home?,"Good day everyone!

I purchased my first home about a year and a half ago from a young couple. I was very satisfied with my home inspection ( just minor issues that have been repaired) and decided to purchase.  The home is on city water and city sewer according to the sellers of the home which they noted on their disclosure. 

A few months ago I noticed my kitchen sink start to back up. The plumbing and drain connect in the basement with a sink in the finished portion of the basement. Both sinks started to back up and it would take a very long time to drain completely. I called a plumber as I tried all home remedies  to unclog  the drain and they all failed. 

The plumber noticed that his attempts to unclog the sink failed so they took a camera through the plumbing and discovered that both of these sinks are not connected to city sewer but to a septic tank that has failed. I did some research and found that in my state when a home is connected to sewer, all drains must use the sewer and all septic fields must be destroyed. 

The problem I am having is that this was not disclosed by the seller. I was very frustrated and spoke with my neighbor about it and he told me that the previous homeowner  ( the one I purchased the home from) installed the septic tank that the kitchen and basement sink drain to. The rest of the house is connected to sewer but not the sinks described. 

I’ll try to wrap this up: the total cost of this project was about 4,000 to connect this drain to the sewer as the main line is about 100 feet away from the kitchen drain. It would be small claims so contacting a lawyer would be out of the question. I contacted the previous home owner and he said he had no clue that there was a septic field. I got my neighbor to fill out an affidavit that he witnessed the instillation of the septic tank. He also described the work the previous home owner did like digging, reseeding grass, and plumbing. I also had my home inspector confirm that there was plumbing work down within the last 3 years. 

So.... do I have a case to sue the previous home owner considering this was not disclosed to me? I feel like I shouldn’t be on the hook for this. 

Thanks in advance!

legaladvice,"Wedding Photographer in Breach of Contract WAY Overdo On Delivering Pictures. Due to Weird Contract Wording, Can We Get In Trouble For Involving a Lawyer?","So, to try to include all pertinent information without entirely giving myself away - my wedding photographer is overdue presenting us with our complete gallery of wedding pictures by several times the agreed upon time in our contract - this is by weeks, not days. The photographer is located in GA (US) and the wedding took place there as well. I’ve tried for weeks now to be reasonable, sending cheerful, happy e-mails asking when I’m actually going to get my wedding pictures. Finally, nearly a week after my last response from her, my husband forwarded the contract to our lawyer with the information and messaged her - still very politely - saying that if she did not have all of our pictures up within a week, we would have to let our lawyer handle the situation. 

After this, we combed over the contract and found a section which says  “All parties agree to cheerful cooperation and communication ... should the client take any issue out of a professional manner for any reason the photographer reserves the right to block and ignore all messages/calls from the client without punishment or negative review.”

Yeah, that should have been a red flag when we signed the contract, but she was the only decent photographer we could afford that didn’t seem to already be booked for our day and she seemed *so nice* at the time. Hindsight is 20/20. Now however... Did bringing up going to a lawyer in an otherwise still very polite e-mail just make it so she can legally ignore us and withhold our wedding pictures?"

legaladvice,Can there be legal repercussions for someone else violating a restraining order? (FL/CT/Internet),"OK first off, obvious throwaway for what I think are obvious reasons.

Second off, sorry for the convoluted title.

Before I make this into a big fuss to end up with it being more trauma than it's worth, I wanted to ask the question of the legal advice community to see how you would proceed.

Basically: I was sexually abused by my father when I was a child. He went to prison, and after he was released from prison he was made to register as a sex offender and I have an order of protection against him stating he can't contact me or my children (all under the age of 10). He lives in CT and I live in Florida. 

My first two kids have a different dad than my youngest (married, my husband died of cancer, remarried). I'm divorced from my youngest child's father after finding out that he was cheating. It was a really rough divorce and he's the kind of person who will do things to hurt me just because he knows it'll hurt me. He knows about the abuse, so it's not something that he could say he was ignorant on. 

His new wife (the woman he cheated on me with) reached out to me yesterday night and said that she felt uncomfortable about the fact that he was sending pictures of our shared child to my dad and wanted me to know. She said that he would take pics of her specifically and tell her he was sending them to my dad because I'm a ""bitch who lied about being molested"". She sent me screenshots of messages. There's nothing in them that would suggest that it's intentionally exploitative to our daughter but obviously I'm NOT okay with it. The specific wording of the order just states that he's not to contact me and not to contact my children, but doesn't say anything about contacting other people to get information on my children. It does say something about how he's not to use social media aliases to attempt to get information, but again, it doesn't say anything about other people. 

My question: is this technically legal or is it in violation of the order? Can I do anything, legally, to prevent my ex from sending photos to him? (I asked him in a polite manner, but he declined.)"

legaladvice,"Neighbor's dog killed all of my chickens over the course of a year,","I live in the city outskirts of Austin, Texas. My neighbor two doors down has two pitbulls who frequently climb the short chain link fence between the yards and come into my yard, and have killed several of my chickens over the past two years. They've gotten good at hiding in my carport and taking to the trees, but I recently built them a massive, very expensive, completely enclosed coop and run. It's like a chicken paradise and I thought it was bulletproof, or at least pitbullproof. I filled it with all of the breeds I've been wanting since I started to keep chickens and they loved jumping in my lap, sitting on my shoulders as I did work, and would follow me around like puppies. I loved those birds. They weren't even old enough to lay.  


I built the enclosure to keep them safe, but two weeks ago I looked out my kitchen window and saw all of the chickens laying dead and feathers covering every inch of the coop. One of the dogs was in the neighbor yard directly across from me, and when it saw me it started barking and went back to its house two doors down. I am devastated. I called animal control like I have the four other times the dogs came to kill my chickens and they told me that they get reports about those dogs all the time and they ""wish they could do more"". Then he went to talk to the neighbor and no one has followed up with me.  


In Texas dogs are considered property so the most they can do, even for attacking someone, is hold them for 10 days and give them back. Last time this happened I talked to the Director of AC and they told me my only recourse is to try to take them to small claims court but the court could only demand the dogs stay on the property and fine them if they got out. They're already in a case about this. I know the neighbors who stay on the opposite side of them, they're 6 ft+ tall, burly mechanics with enormous dogs of their own who have also been attacked by these pits and have had to call animal control, and they've said they're not comfortable talking to the owners, either.

I don't want to take these people to court and then find my dog poisoned, or my tires slashed, and then their dogs are still running at large. The neighbor behind me said that he's heard the dogs have bit someone at a bus stop and killed another neighbor's cats. They tried to attack me the last time they were in my yard and I was literally brandishing a knife and yelling at them until they got back over the fence since my dog was outside in the carport. The city won't do a single thing about it. I'm at the end of my rope and am not sure what to do. I want these dogs gone, and so does everyone else I've spoken with.  


Is anyone familiar with Texas or animal law, or has any advice on steps to take to get these dangerous dogs removed?"

legaladvice,Employer does not want to pay agreed upon holiday rate. Can they retroactively change my pay rate for hours I already worked?,"(Indiana)

My company handbook (which I was required to sign and agree to when hired) says that when an employee works during a holiday, they will be paid their holiday pay AND ""a premium double rate"". This is equivalent to three times my daily pay. When I brought this up after working a holiday, they said they would only pay the holiday pay and my regular rate for the 8 hours I worked.

I pressed the issue and showed them the handbook, and they agreed that the holiday plus double pay IS how the handbook is written. They are now saying that they are going to amend the handbook to take that rule away and since they are amending the handbook before the pay period the holiday was in is paid out, they will not have to pay me the original rate. Can they really do this?

The DOL for my state does not accept complaints relating to holiday or bonus pay, so that is not an option for me.

Edit: I misquoted the handbook. What is actually says is ""employees who work on company holidays are entitled to a premium pay AND (emphasis mine) twice their normal wages for hours worked"". It is additionally specified that  8 hours of holiday pay are to be paid out for employees who work company holidays. Whether or not this is the ""premium pay"" referenced in the first quote, I do not know."

legaladvice,Boyfriend’s work paying him late,"New York, NY

My boyfriend works for a small company with probably 15-20 employees in NYC. The owner/founder takes care of pretty much everything managerial and financial. He has an accountant who handles payroll. My boyfriend is a part time, hourly employee. He is paid above minimum wage. I have two questions: 

1. Their pay periods are twice monthly (so periods end on the 1st and 15th of every month). From what I understand, legally, his boss has one week from end of payroll to pay him (ie the 8th and 22nd, respectively). However, his paychecks are consistently deposited late — up to 5 days later than the 8th or 22nd (he still hasn’t received his paycheck for the period ending on the 15th, and his boss said it will likely be deposited on the 27th, maybe the 28th). I’ve read that if his paychecks are beyond a week late, he is supposed to receive additional pay. I think what I read was 1.5 times the paycheck, but I’m not sure. Is this true? 
2. His boss will “fine” him for things like: not wearing uniform or being “late” (he is supposed to show up to classes 15 minutes early, but sometimes trains will delay and he’s only 5 minutes early or there right as class starts). The law seems confusing on this because he is paid above minimum wage. His adjusted hourly wage is still above minimum wage when the fines are taken out. He has never consented to these fines in writing. Is this legal?

We will be moving in a couple of months and he will be leaving this job, so I am hesitant to do anything to cause him to lose the job or have reduced hours. I’m just not sure what we should do, or if he even has any sort of case in the first place. 

Thanks in advance!"

A few months ago, she was seeing this guy and on the day of her birthday party they were fooling around in the hotel room before guests arrived. Basically long story short, despite her telling him multiple times not to cum in her, he did and his sole reaction was ""oops"". 
About a month later, she noticed that her period had come early. At the time of the incident she wasn't on birth control pills, but since then she had started, or more like, restarted taking them, and therefore her periods should be regular. 
She went to the hospital to get it checked out as she was also nauseous and couldn't keep food down for long and the doctors immediately suspected a miscarriage. 

She had to go through multiple tests, see multiple doctors, etc... and this guy, who by now had found someone else to fuck around with, basically left her to cover all the expenses on her own. He initially said he would help cover, but when asked to pay back, he basically laughed in her face. 

She's wondering if there's anything she can do. She did consent to sleeping with him, but she didn't consent to him cumming in her. In fact she repeatedly told him to pull out. She feels gross, and abused, and we just want to figure out what we can do to help her.

My husband kept telling her we will see I don’t know when your daughter is coming home yet. My mom continually messaged him through out the week asking the same thing every time. My husband irritated and frustrated, as he took a week of FMLA to stay home w the kids, finally told her no she can not come over this weekend. I want her home Incase her mom gets out, which you(my mother) should be more concerned over. Now I gave my mother the information to get ahold of me, as I could not have my cell phone while I was in there.

Well that was unacceptable for my mother so that Friday she does and files for grandparents visitation, I am not served the paperwork until yesterday almost a week after she filed. Literally within 10 minutes of me being served, as I’m standing outside smoking and on the phone w a friend upset about the petition, I see my mother driving slowly past my house. I’m getting to the point where I am concerned that my mother might try to kidnap or talk to my daughter. I’m lost. I was feeling so much better after my hospital stay and now all that is being shit on by the drama my mother is causing. I don’t know what to do to get her to stop harassing me. My husband is at his wits end. Help! I need advice."
legaladvice,"Is it legal for an app developer, restrict his app to not work if my phone have a certain app from another developer?","Let's say if Google app refuses to work because I have the Bing app installed.


Real case scenario, I have a theme app that I legally purchased and therefore I can use (correct of I'm wrong).
And in said app, somewhere in it's programming, there's a detection that if it detects a certain app, Lucky Patcher in this case, it simply refuses to work.

Lucky Patcher (LP from now on), is mainly used for piracy as a means to disrupt the license verification in apps, or also, to disrupt the in app purchases.

It can however be used for legit purposes, like the use I made of it.

So, can the dev implement such a lock that even if LP isn't doing anything to said (or any) app at the moment, lockout the user from using it, or sabotaging the final experience on the app? Being the only solution to uninstall LP.
Also, worth mentioning that in the license agreement there's no mention of that ""feature"" nor any place else.
I only know of this because support told me to uninstall LP (as if they already knew I had it, I presume because the results from the app, idk).

Edit1: the color scheme on the theme was off the expected, that's all I told the support, and they already knew from there that it was LP.
Means that it was indeed planned.

Location I presume it's under United States laws as it's an Android app from Google Play Store."
legaladvice,"[MI] Received an ominous, threatening text from a man I don't know who may be trying to hurt me?","Hi there, I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm pretty spooked right now and am just reaching out for some input. I just received a text from a random number containing a screenshot of a man's mugshot/arrest record who was arrested in May of 2019 for ""Domestic battery by strangulation"", with the caption ""Last year"". I've never seen the man before in my life. I responded, ""Umm, what? Who is this?"" and he replied by saying he was the guy in the mugshot, and ""I'm everywhere.""  


According to the arrest record (which I was able to find on my own online as well), he was arrested in a county in Florida that I used to live in. I've since moved to Michigan, but I'm still pretty shaken up by all this and how random it was. I blocked the number immediately but I'm not sure where to go from here; should I make a police report or should I just wait a while and see how it plays out? Is there anything I can do to make sure I'm protected? Thanks."
legaladvice,Sisters Eviction. Priority: My things.,"I live in AZ. with my sister who was on vacation when a police officer told us we were being evicted today.

legaladvice,MN child support/paternity,"Oddly specific question and for my emotional well-being I would rather not go into the backstory just yet (it’s been an emotional day). I have made up my mind to fight for custody as things have not been going well  between my daughter’s mother and myself in regards to our verbal agreement. I am wondering if I get a paternity test that determines I am not the biological father will it then give me footing to ask for my child support payments to be cancelled ? I currently pay the highest amount allowed while simultaneously seeing my daughter as much as her mother allows. I will be going to court soon with the goal of joint physical and legal custody but heard of some cases where the legal father is no longer obligated if it is determined he is not the biological father. I have signed a recognition of parentage which I do not believe can be rescinded nor do I really want that, but as a back up plan I want to know if asking for a paternity test is worth it. I do not bring this up lightly as I care deeply for my child but things between her mother and I have been so bad for so long that I feel if I am not awarded joint custody things will only get worse.

legaladvice,Wife was paid the wrong salary all year. Can her company demand the money back?,"I was looking at my wife’s W-2 and her wages seemed higher than they should have been. I had her show me a pay stub and it turns out she was paid 20% more than she thought she was making. 

She started this job this year after having our second child. She works four days a week. The email chain she has with her boss negotiating her salary shows them agreeing to a set salary and vacation amount prorated to four days per week. However, the official offer letter from her company (signed by my wife) shows her full salary and says she will work four days per week, but does not mention prorating the salary. 

It’s mind boggling to me that her company sent her an incorrect offer letter and never noticed they were paying her too much (and that my wife never looked at her pay stubs). Can her company demand the money back, even though her signed offer letter reflects the salary she was paid? We live in New Jersey and she works in New York.

Update: my wife spoke to her boss this morning and they are letting her keep all the money they paid her last year. Her boss is having a meeting with the CFO later today regarding how they should handle her pay moving forward. It seems like keeping her at the higher salary is on the table."
legaladvice,I think Walmart ruined my engine... Looking for advice. MICHIGAN.,"So Saturday, January 18th of 2020 I got and oil change on my equinox at the local Walmart. I have been there a few times and they are affordable albeit a bit slow. After about 20 minutes I went back up and they told me I was good to go. Fast forward to Monday, the 20th and I am driving to work. My engine makes a loud bang and then starts smoking and making lots of bad noises (I am not a car guy). I called my insurance and had it taken to a shop.

On the 22nd I get a call saying that the dipstick was dry and that the problem as that there was no oil in the engine. I got my windshield wipers fixed a week prior and that shop didn't inform me of an oil leak. I also checked the pavement where I parked the night prior and saw no signs of any leakage.

I called the Walmart and they said that a manger would review their videos but I am unsure this will resolve anything. I am just looking for any advice.

legaladvice,[FL] Can I get emergency/temporary proxy or liaison over a mentally ill adult?,"[Central Florida]

Good evening, to clarify the title a bit: I am wondering if I can be awarded some kind of proxy/liaison/advocate status of my spouse due to an emergency health issue.

I had to have my spouse baker acted after a suicide attempt, and he is in a psychiatric treatment center for at least 72 hrs. So far he’s only called and reached out to me, and left me the burden of telling his family about the situation (they’ve been calling him for days and he hasn’t answered).

The problem is, the moment I told his family, his mother and siblings expressed an extreme desire to go to the facility and have him discharged early as they don’t believe in mental health issues and they think they can “talk some sense into him”.

I know the facility won’t release him until they’re comfortable but this behavior from the family is disturbing. My spouse is not in a good state of mind, and I’m very concerned that once he calls them that they’ll be able to persuade him to not go to treatments, counseling, therapy, etc.

I really want him to get the help he needs and I don’t want his family to try to undermine that, especially because I know he doesn’t want to be there. I don’t need them to prey on that.
Because he is being treated for a mental health issue and is still under that baker act hold, is there some way I can push for a temporary health care proxy or some type of document stating I can make medical decisions for him? I really think it would be in his best interest if he took the professional care being offered and I don’t want his poor emotional state to make bad decisions.

Thank you &amp; I hope I’ve articulated my thought well enough"
legaladvice,Is it legal to record a street performer and post it online?,"This happened in Greece,so European Laws apply.

So today at the traffic light, there was a performer that was on a unicycle and juggling (bowling?) pins. So I took my phone out and started recording from afar. I would say that he isn't recognizable with the bad quality of the video and the distance but give me both views if possible (if he was/wasn't). So before the light gets green he comes to me and says that I don't have the right to record him without consent and he asked for money etc etc. I told him that afaik recording a public event isn't illegal , but whatever I did delete the video in front of him and went my way.

legaladvice,At a loss what to do and need some guidance,"I need some really good advice. I also apologise for the extremely long post but I'm at a complete loss in how to defend my rights anymore. 

Recently at my job there has been a lot of conflicts going around. I tolerate a lot, but this is beyond conflict martyrdom. 

I recently offered to move locations to a higher volume store with my manager. I was offered more hours with the move, as well as a pay increase to accommodate my extra travel once officially transferred. After the ASM stepped down I was also offered the position but told to wait until the investigation was over. (Before transfer I can put in for travel costs through a form I just recently found out about). Everything was great. My manager and I are close and I hit the ground running to get the new store back on track to be a great performing store again, something the company hasn't seen in years. I was making my goals here and then some, always 10%+ over what was asked of me to make for the store. My KPIs (key performance indicators) were through the roof. I was the dream employee as quoted by my DM and SM. 
It was a rocky start. My two new coworkers (the 2 out of 4 of us, let's call them co-worker A and B) didn't like things changing (as they never did their jobs anyway) and starting causing problems. 
My manager told me what needed to be done, which was generally a lot and I got right down to it; organizing, cleaning, etc. Co-worker A, didn't like my take charge attitude and started a bunch of drama at the store, saying I was rude to him and bossing him around, even though the only interaction I ever had with him was a polite request to help me move some product around bc I couldn't do it alone. He's a young guy (like early 20s). He also has this huge thug-life personality, draws a lot of gangster art on company supplies, carves into the fixtures when he's bored and has broken several things in the store out of anger. 
I'm encouraged to write a statement per my manager and district manager for the hostile environment I'm experiencing so they can bump it to HR. Fantastic!
At the same time, my manager starts battling against the (now former) assistant manager, co-worker B, as she kept calling off work or coming in late by a few hours. She was asked to step down as an assistant bc of her hours and availability. Completely irrelevant to the fact that she screamed racist comments at another manager from a different store and all the uncalled for outbursts she has thrown. Now co-worker B is pregnant so even though she was asked to step down or change her availability as an assistant manager, she was also informed THREE times that she would lose her pay and benefits bc she could only offer about 15 hours of availability. She agreed to step down and the change was made. Then she changed her mind and cried to HR saying it wasn't clear that she would lose anything if she stepped down. 

Needless to say corporate stepped in and started to investigate the situation. This battle lasted longer than it should have (3 months) and ended thusly as follows:

Co-worker A had a breakdown at work and charged at my manager in front of my district manager in an attempt to attack my manager. He was put on a forced leave of absence until the investigation was over. Not fired, just suspension. This suspension lasted a few weeks before they finally terminated him. Before the attack he was found hanging out in other stores while the only associate on duty, swearing at customers (listen motherfucker, fuck you, you bitch) and making racist remarks about how us white bitches came in and changed everything bc we hate Muslims (which is his faith and also not true, we just wanted him to do the job he was paid to do, it had nothing to do with religion). 

Co-worker B got off free and clear. She got her assistant manager pay back which she rubs in everyone's face every chance she gets, her maternity leave, and full benefits; without any of the responsibility of an ASM. She also still shows up whenever she feels like it, (2 hours late the other day bc she was getting her nails done) and uses company time to park her car (which doesn't take 45 minutes) and set up appointments for her kid's modeling gigs. 

My manager was scolded for this whole incident saying that we could have handled it better 🤷 

I got the shit end of the stick. I am no longer allowed to work with my manager bc it was found that I am too friendly with her. I am not getting my transfer put through. I am not being promoted to assistant manager. I have worked 50+ hours since September every week and I still don't qualify for health insurance bc I haven't worked 40+ for 6 months. I'm losing my hours. I'm being shipped back to a store I was underperforming in, where they are now fully staffed, left with the crumbs of hours. I'm being punished for putting up with a nightmare for 4 months and lost everything from the company I had worked so hard to obtain over the course of the year. 

I also found out that our new hire, the one to replace co-worker A, makes $18/hr as a new employee with no customer service experience while I had to fight to get my $11/hr with 15+ years experience during my hiring.

I'm losing this battle of caring anymore about this place and honestly if I wasn't moving soon, I'd just quit today. I'm tired, overworked, and just feeling disheartened about a company I felt so strongly about the vision they had and the passion I poured into learning my job and being the best. 

So what should I do? Should I contact lawyers? What are my rights in Illinois? Is it even worth the battle?"

legaladvice,My housemate is an abusive jerk and I’m scared of him,"I know I should call the police but I’m afraid to. I rent a room with a bunch of people I don’t know.  I know: “of course there’s a problem you don’t know anyone” well yeah but everyone here has been nice to me the problem is a bit more complicated or I’m making it more complicated than it needs to be because I’m just anxious and what I hear is scary. Also it’s the only place I could afford at the time when I needed to move out of my old apartment and couldn’t find anyone who needed a roommate. Anyways: We each have our own room, a key to our own room, and the only shared area is the kitchen and two bathrooms. The house is three floors. I live on the second floor and I’m constantly hearing my housemate fight(on the same floor down the hall) verbally, and physically abuse his girlfriend. I admit that I kind of spy on them but only when I hear him raise his voice and all I do is stand in the hallway and listen but I have since moved to just putting my ear to my door because I’m afraid he can hear me open and close my door. I’ve heard him threaten to kill and dismember men women and children and I have video of him saying this. I have many videos of him yelling at his girlfriend while I’m in the hallway listening. I have filed a report with the police but since then I have been afraid because I know he has a gun and I have a feeling he knows I’m on his a**. I’m probably being paranoid but the 9 other people who live in this house either don’t care or don’t notice and I’ve only noticed because I’ve been in living situations where I’ve heard domestic abuse but the difference is those were in apartment buildings where there are way more than 9 people living in the building. Here there are only 9 other people living here and he isn’t loud enough to raise suspicion in neighboring houses or any passerby outside. Not only am I afraid of my safety but I’m afraid for the safety of his girlfriend and the other tenants in this house who have been very civil and kind and the worst I’ve heard from any of them is probably them having sex(the walls are thin as paper here) I’ve heard him threaten this woman by saying no one will help her and if they were to help her they would have to kill him to save her. I emailed my landlord about noise complaints and hearing the abuse but I have not heard anything back and I’ve looked up if there’s anything they can even do but so far I’ve found they can do nothing. I should note that I know or have reason to firmly believe he has a gun. There was an incident where I heard him threaten his girlfriend with said gun. I’ve heard him on the phone when I first moved in threaten to kill someone but that was on the phone. I’m sure it’s all talk and I have nothing to worry about but I’m not only thinking about my safety I’m thinking of that woman’s safety and the safety of the 9 other tenants in this building who possibly have no idea of what is going on and only I do because I’m unlucky enough to be up at 1-4am hearing all this. Recently it seems to have gotten worse. In my heart and own common sense I know I should CALL THE COPS but again I’m terrified to. I know that’s a lame excuse but believe me when I say I’m terrified of this man because of what I’ve heard which could very much be empty threats but I now sleep with a knife next to my bed and I don’t stay in the kitchen too long anymore if I do i make sure I have my taser and am ready to defend myself with whatever pot or pan I’m using to cook my meal. I need to know if there’s anything I can do to get him out of the house. I feel awful but I know I can’t do anything to help his girlfriend unless she seeks help herself and me getting involved could only make it worse."
legaladvice,Boss Never Mailed Last 2 Paychecks or W2,"So my old boss is kind of a nightmare. It was the first time I actually just had to quit via text with no 2 weeks notice. I don’t feel good about that, but it became too unbearable to tough it out another few weeks. And to be honest, the way he ran things, he didn’t really deserve that level or professional courtesy. 
The issue I’m having now is that it’s been over a month and he hasn’t mailed me my paychecks, despite having my address. I was also told by a coworker that he apparently never mails W2’s and requires people to pick them up. 

I had one awful boss before where I had quit and had to stop by to get my W2 and she proceeded to berate me while holding my W2 until she felt like handing it to me. 
I don’t want to ever set foot in that place again. I’ve been told be friends that he’s legally required to mail my W2. 
What rights do I have regarding receiving these items?

legaladvice,City is requiring neighborhood households to pay $7k+ each to replace sidewalks (Idaho),"All the houses on my street (and some nearby streets) received a letter on Jan. 18 stating that all households would be required to pay for new gutters, curbs, and sidewalks in March. Apparently it's part of the Local Improvement District's efforts to make the neighborhood ADA compliant. The letter says residents must also install a 'bumpout' near mailboxes so people can move around them.

Each resident's letter includes a map of their property showing the square footage of their sidewalk/driveway and corresponding costs. The map shows 3 foot wide sidewalks, which is what we currently have. Per the map, I have \~60 square yards of concrete, which they calculate as costing $8,300 to replace. Residents who live on corners are receiving estimates of $14,000+.

To make matters worse, the city is now sending out updated notices saying they have decided to require 5-foot wide sidewalks and bumpouts, which means we will now be losing two feet of yard and will require many of us to move our sprinkler systems. My new estimate is over $10,000 (not counting the sprinklers) and corner residents are over $15,000. A quick Google search tells me ADA only requires 3-foot sidewalks, so I don't know why the sidewalks need to be widened so much.

The letter states that anyone who cannot pay for the new sidewalks can have a lien put on their house (with an indeterminate interest rate) to pay over 10 years. This is not a wealthy neighborhood, so it seems unlikely that many people are going to be able to come up with $10-15k in two months' time. 

Some of my neighbors have spoken to city officials who said the city is rebuilding the road, which is why new sidewalks are required. I'm no concrete expert, but this seems wasteful, especially since a majority of the sidewalks on the street are already in great shape (my neighbor just put in new sidewalks two years ago).

The city says there will be a hearing on Feb. 5, but that the City Council has final say and whatever they decide will be mandatory.

Is there anything we can do about this?"

I have a 7 year old son with my ex husband. I’m newly married and my new husband wants to adopt my son. I have always had sole custody of my son. My ex husband has no problem giving up his rights and allowing my new husband to adopt our son. My attorney is filing the adopt paperwork for me. I live out of state. He had filed my custody paperwork so I felt comfortable using him again. He quotes me $1,000 to file the adopting paperwork and said it would be an easy process since ex husband was willing to hand relinquish parental rights. 

When it comes time to send off the paperwork to be signed and notarized I realize that the paperwork on my ex-husbands forms are incorrect. It has the wrong names, children etc. I call my attorney immediately to have them rectify the paperwork and resend them to my ex. They apologize profusely, said it was their fault and that they will fix it immediately. A few weeks go by and my ex and I submit the paperwork. I get an email today stating that they will not be filing the adoption request until I pay my $1,500 bill (I had already paid them the $1,000). On the cost breakdown list is the charge for the email I sent them noting the errors along with a charge for their time fixing the errors. I’m at a loss for words. Is this common practice? Can I fight this? I’m worried they will end up charging me more..

legaladvice,Insurance debt collector (WA),"So sometime in July of 2019 I was pulling out of my parking space at work and I accidentally dented the right bumper of the car parked next to me. I parked back in and talked to the owner of the car who witnessed the whole thing. It wasn’t bad or anything, the back bumper was just a bit dented (I can probably find pictures if you guys need some). At the time I didn’t have insurance so I asked the guy if I can pay him cash or pay for his car to get fixed myself but he said he’s gonna take it to his insurance company. He gets my information and a few days pass before he contacts me to tell me that he talked about it with his insurance agent and if I pay him $600 cash I won’t need to worry about it anymore. I paid him the money and wrote a paper receipt of it.

The problem is that I’ve been getting calls from a debt collector who’s saying that I owe over $1,000 from that same incident. I thought this issue was resolved but suddenly now I owe a lot of money. What should I do? I panicked so I blocked the number after I got the call and I don’t want to call back because I have anxiety and phone calls make me nervous."

legaladvice,Bathroom Reno Surprise: discovered there is no concrete pad at all under our main bathroom floor! (Western Australia),"Made the decision I wanted to move house recently and decided to start renos to prepare the house for sale. I began a bathroom renovation this week on the main bathroom in my home. We had had some ants and a bit of a mouldy bathroom vanity and on inspection had found some evidence of water damage to the home (eg: some paint bubbling etc) on the adjacent walls of rooms next to the bathroom and started to put two and two together. 
 
We first started removing tiles in the shower and found no evidence of waterproofing membrane present which was concerning. Further investigation under the vanity sink’s bottom shelf found a mess of builder’s rubble and sand. 

I removed the bricks under the bath and found that these, as well as the bath itself were sitting directly on top of builders sand scree which I’m told is normal to a depth of 30-40mm after which I should have encountered concrete slab. 
I removed some floor tiles in front of the bath and found only builders sand. After careful excavation straight down under the bath I encountered a single layer of black plastic on which the concrete slab should be sitting. Hoping the concrete was possibly under that black plastic I went further - now to a depth of around 17cm below the level of the floor tiles. No concrete still. 
Have contacted my insurance company, and am ordering an independent engineers report on this situation. Quite concerned now that may have been repeated in my en-suite bathroom which also has some evidence of mould building up, I looked behind a chest of drawers in the bedroom adjacent the my en-suite sink and shower. The paint there also has a sheen of mould plus a little paint bubbling behind the kid’s bedroom cupboard and possible floor board warping. This seems to point toward the en-suite also potentially having no concrete slab beneath the tiles. 
I am amazed that a prominent (and still very much in business) Perth building company that prides itself on a quality build and expert design could let such poor workmanship pass inspection. I had planned to contact this building company next week which is as soon as possible for me after completing my own minor inspections and investigations on close of business Friday afternoon (yesterday). 

Our House built in the year 2000. Advice relating to my specific situation, actions I should take and any relevant legal or related perspectives from this community would be most appreciated.

Kind Regards :)

legaladvice,NYC - little side hustle is evolving and want to make sure I file properly,"Hey friends

Over a year ago, I started posting artwork online, and after a bit of publishing on sites and making some sales, I recognized that I was interested in doing this for a while, and got my EIN. Since it was all arts and crafts, I had filed under Retail. 

I have a pretty in-depth tech background, and there have been times my interest in arts and technology overlap. I was also approached regarding freelancing for a local business owner, and wanted to make sure I understood what I would be doing going forward.

I would love to work with the local business, but want to keep it under the same EIN when we get to billing. The idea of getting a new EIN for this opportunity (with no guarantee that we'd even move forward on it) seems silly, however I am open to taking more freelance jobs as time goes on. 

I know that I can use [this page](https://tax-irs-ein.com/application/sole-proprietor) to update my business and have it better reflect the Primary Activity. Would that be necessary to do if I wanted to offer freelancing services to local shops? Or take on consultation gigs?

If my understanding is right, I should be ok to carry on and leave it as retail, but wanted to be sure before I tried locking into something that might need more work to get done. 

Thanks in advance!"
legaladvice,Issue with getting identification from parents [SC],"This is actually regarding my girlfriend.  She is 20 and has been living away from home for almost 2 years now.  They do not speak to each other at all.  This is in South Carolina if that matters also.

So she has never had an actual Identification Card or License.  She has had a school ID, and obviously a SS card and Birth Certificiate.  Her parents are the ones who have those documents at their house, and are refusing to give them to my girlfriend.  She is unable to get employment or help to sign a lease or get a license because she is unable to prove who she is.  In order to get a replacement birth certificate, she needs either an ID or Social Security card.  In order to get a replacement Social Security card, she needs a photo ID.  In order to get a photo ID she needs her Birth Certificate or Social.  It seems like there is nothing we can do to get any of her documents.  We even went as far as to call the authorities to her parents house to get help retrieving her documents, since she is over 18 and those are HER legal documents...but the cops simply asked her mother where they were, and her mother said she had no idea...and that was the end of that.

So does anybody know what we can do at all...if anything?  We have been to the health department, the DMV, and social security office...and none of them can do anything without some verification from the other.  This is extremely hard because she is not able to gain employment due to not having any source of identification.

Thanks guys."
legaladvice,Rescheduling Court Dates When the Date Falls Within a Deployment,"A few months ago I was in a minor fender bender and as it usually happens the police always have to find someone to give a citation to. They gave it to me and set a court date for me and as any good American citizen should, I chose to exercise my right to a trial. I firmly believe in the trial system and no matter the scale of the trial or if you intend on pleading guilty or not, you should always go to court.

Now the tricky part comes in that, I am active duty Army and I was set to deploy soon, at the time of the accident there was not concrete date yet but even then the projected departures were well past the court date so all was fine. Until very recently I was given a few weeks notice that I was leaving and it turned out to be on the same day as my trial. So I did some preemptive googling and found what was a way to reschedule the trial. The only hurdle though was that you had to reschedule it in person at the courthouse. Figured that it would be no big deal but the specific clerk's office I was suppose to check in with closes everyday at 1600/0400pm, when I normally don't get out of work until 1700, as well as had a thousand other tasks that normally take a few months to accomplish in only a couple of weeks. I just physically wasn't able to make it to the courthouse until today, but even then by the skin of my teeth walking in at 1550 when all the ladies were packing up to go home.

I talk to the clerk and she tells me that I didn't read the information of the website correctly, in that only City court offenses may be rescheduled whereas County offenses (which mine was) cannot be rescheduled and that my court date on the ticket was actually a first appearance to put in a plea with an actual trial date to be set 4-8 weeks later, and that my only options where use this day as my first appearance to either plea guilty and pay the fine then and there or not guilty and set an impossible trial appearance as I would be overseas doing hooah shit to only return home to a nice fancy arrest warrant for failing to appear at court.

I explained to her my situation, but she was firm about the ultimatum and because I was short on time and that it was only a 120 traffic ticket I elected to just plea guilty and pay the fine. I much would have rather had gone and gotten an attorney and gone in another day but I got places to be and shit to blow up, so really this post is more of a what could I had done and maybe to give advice to any other service members if they get got up in a similar situation.

legaladvice,My car was stolen from the “secure area” of the dealership,"My car has had a lot of problems in the time that I’ve owned it. I bought it new and it’s a 2015 Kia Optima. This time I was having problems with my car not going faster than 35-ish mph. So the dealership came and picked it up. I had some engine problems about 6 months ago and they said they were going to fix the knock sensor (I think that’s what they said) but i would probably have to get the engine replaced at some point. 

I heard back from the dealership and this time the engine needed to be replaced as well as the catalytic converter. They gave me a loaner and said it would be about 4 weeks until I would get my car back. 

On Tuesday I got a call from the Service Manager saying that I should file a police report because they thought my car had been stolen. He seemed really concerned, but I honestly thought they forgot where they parked my car. However I went to the police station and filed a report. The police said that I should not involve my insurance company yet because cars are usually found within a day. I didn’t listen to that advice and called the insurance company as soon as I got home. 

Turns out the dealership thought since my car had so many problems (which it totally did) that they left the keys in my car. The same night my car was stolen, a few other cars were broken into and things were stolen out of some trunks of the other cars. 

The police did end up finding my car the next day, so that’s kind of good news. My insurance company is kind of helpful, but the person assigned to my case keeps acting like I’m making this out to be a big deal. I’ve been very calm this whole time and haven’t really asked for much. She told me to call her back if the car didn’t run, so I did because the towing company told me the car wouldn’t start and the key fob was mia. When I called her back to tell her this she literally said “well I don’t know what you expect me to do about this, you need to go get your car.” 

I asked her to send someone out to check the damage and the adjuster said that she was able to provide an estimate based on the scratches on the vehicle and windows only, since the car won’t start. The paint alone is going to be at least $5k. Who knows if there is any other damage to the car. 

The dealership is going to pick up the car and pay the towing fees but I keep getting pushed to other people and I have no idea what to do. I don’t want to keep my car because I don’t believe it will be repaired. The insurance will not total it, but I also don’t want the dealership to do the repairs. Do I have any options? Where do I even start?"
legaladvice,Job paid the old minimum wage,"New Jersey announced in Feb 2019 that the minimum wage would rise from $8.85 per hour to $10 per hour starting July 1, 2019. My friend signed a contract in spring 2019 to work for a summer camp, which he did from late June through July, roughly 6 weeks, 180 hours total. Even though the minimum wage was $10 when he worked, they paid him $8.85 as that was the minimum wage when the contract was signed.

He told me this, and I thought it sounds odd to be paid less than minimum wage. Is what the summer camp did legal?"
legaladvice,"Biweekly mortgage payment Washington, D.C.","Fiancé and I just bought a house in Washington, D.C., USA that we planned on making both extra payments and biweekly payments on. Both of these types of payments greatly reduce the length of loan and amount of interest paid. Looked at contract with lender and saw that there was no penalty for prepayments and biweekly payments were an option. 

A few days ago, I try to set up our recurring payments and find out the small print. You can only make biweekly payments if you are a month ahead AND even THEN they will keep the first payment in a holding account and not apply it to the balance until the second payment of the month comes through. This essentially defeats the purpose of paying biweekly (reducing principle that has interest faster). I called and they said there is no way to make “partial payments” on a loan, though I wouldn’t characterize being a month ahead and then paying two weeks at a time as partial. 

Is it legal practice for them to put these additional payments the date we send them in as well as put any extra we throw at it in “a holding account” and not apply it until the full month of mortgage is collected? Again, this is assuming we’ve already paid the bill for that month and are paying on top of that (i.e., mortgage due March 1st was paid feb 1st and then we pay half of April on march 1 and second half on march 15)

It seems like really shady and deceptive practice. What are options and is this legal?

EDIT: they said the same holding account scenario applies even with manually initiated payments, not just recurring."
legaladvice,"[CA] Left a bad (but honest) review, being threatened with small claims","I hired a dog sitter through Rover to sit for our 4-5m.o. puppy. Prior to his stay, we were clear that four month old puppies require more attention than adult dogs, and that we didn't want him left alone all day long. The sitter responded and said that while he was going to be unavailable from four hours per day on the first two days, he would be mostly available. We stated that we understood that it was an extra commitment, but that we were willing to pay him accordingly for the extra time spent.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first two days of the booking, the sitter did not follow instructions (nor did he do what he stated he would do) and essentially neglected our dog (we had Nest footage and Fi Collar GPS data). On the first day, he said he would arrive at 2pm, he arrived at 3:30, stayed for five minutes and left for more than two hours. We called him that day, to ask what had happened, and noted that our dog had been alone for 9 hours that day. He stated that ""it was just a crazy day"" and that the next day he would only leave him for 1-1.5 hours roughly twice. We also stated that his exercise needs are roughly 2-3 miles on a normal day. The sitter did not walk him at all on the first day (the only walking he got was by another person who we hired for gap coverage in the period he said he would be absent), and walked him roughly 3/4 of a mile on the second day,. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the second day, he was left alone for roughly 7.5 hours between 8am and 5pm (the sitter was home for a few 5 minute chunks and one roughly 1.5h chunk). At this point, we lined up another sitter to replace him, and asked that he vacate our apartment by the following morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

We stated in a message that we felt entitled to a refund for the two days that the sitter did not stay, and part of the price for the days when he did stay due to his treatment of our dog, although we did not specify an amount. The sitter admitted he had screwed up, stated plainly that he agreed with my assessment, and (this is the important part) **provided a full refund of the stay of his own volition, with no terms attached** (no stated expectation that we not leave a review or that we only leave a positive one, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, it came time to leave a review and we left an honest one. Now, he is threatening to sue us in small claims court if we do not remove the review or pay him back.

&amp;#x200B;

I would have been fine paying half of his original rate for those two days, since that is roughly the amount of care we provided. I was not expecting him to provide a full refund, and yet he did. All this said, I will not be extorted into removing an honest review that will protect other members of my community from this person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've already looked into California's SLAPP laws and CRFA, which I'm pretty sure cover us here. We've lost the Nest cam footage, unfortunately (we don't pay for the long subscription), but have the Fi Collar data indefinitely, and conversations detailing our expectations and his stating that he would meet them. All conversation about the refund, his choice to give it to us in full, his request that we pay him or remove the review, and the threat of small claims court are all in writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are we liable here? Is there anything I am missing as I prepare to defend myself in small claims court?"
legaladvice,Possible wrongful dismissal?m(Canada),"Hi there, I'm in Canada (let me know if it's important to know the province for different laws maybe?). I was recently fired from a job during a ""probationary period"" (That I was never told existed) due to too many absences. I was absent due to a diagnosed mental problem that I can get documentation for. The reason I am here asking is because I feel like the company made a point of avoiding dealing with people with mental illness in order to weed them out and put it down to ""oh, you were fired due to poor performance and absence"". Now, the reason I am mad about this is because I was told several times when I first went off sick by my leader (or manager would be similar -the business had many departments and ""teams"" that had leaders or coaches) that she didn't want to hear reasons why someone is calling in sick because she wouldn't want to have to explain why she was sick to somone and that it was a trust thing etc. I take issue with this because I felt the need to explain why I was off for a longer period then was accepted by the company and I felt like they didn't want to hear it so that they could fire someone without letting it be known that they were firing someone because they had disabilities. 

I'm hesitant about even posting this because it was 4 months ago and I'm afraid it looks bad that I waited this long. 

I'm not even sure I've explained this well but please, ask me questions if needed. I've sunk pretty low since this all happened because quite frankly, I truly believed this was my dream job and I was meant to do this. 

Thanks for any help and your time."

legaladvice,[Oregon] URGENT. Lactation requirements and accommodations for employees.,"I work at a large nationwide company that employs hundreds of people at this one facility. We have a single lactation room that is essentially a tiny converted CLOSEST that is home to a chair and a barely working mini fridge. There is no lock on the door and the only thing preventing other employees from entering is a sign that we are suppose to put up. They still use this room as a storage room.

I have tried to look up all of the important information in regards to my actual legal rights when it comes to my lactation accommodations, however it's very confusing and I'm not sure what I can request at this point. I work a 12 hours shift 3 days a week so it's essential that I am accommodated properly. 

These are my primary concerns.

* There is no sink to wash my breast pump parts. I am forced to go into the restroom (non private) if I want to wash them. To protect my child, I feel it's important that I am able to do this, but it's embarrassing when someone walks in and sees this. Plus, how would you feel if you had to wash your dishes in a public restroom? Not great right?
* A single mini fridge is the only thing available to chill many employees breast milk. Multiple people pump during the 3 day work week. This location has &gt; 200 employees on this shift alone. 
* The room is not dedicated to lactation and is used by other employees when they need something out of storage. There is also no lock! 

I have read over [https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2593](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2593) and [https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2341/](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2341/) as well as look through [https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/659A.121](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/659A.121), but I'm still not sure what I should do in this situation. 

This was already brought up about 3 years ago by another employee, and the current lactation room is the result of those efforts. Is there anything I can do?

Is it unreasonable to request a Sink, Lock, Larger Fridge, and 100% private room be made available?"

legaladvice,Employer switched pay from hourly + commission to salary without contract. Significant pay cut. (OHIO),"I apologize if this is the wrong sub or wrong flair.  Throwaway account because of the nature of the business and details will be somewhat limited because it is a niche business even statewide.

I have worked for a small business (less than 20 employees), for the past 10 years.  I have been on an hourly wage from the date I started till my last paycheck, the first one of this year.  At the end of the year I was making $20 an hour +overtime and commission if I made a sale.  

I was presented with the opportunity of a role change into strict sales in mid September of 2019, but I was never given a contract or the opportunity to negotiate/define any expectations of a new role in the company.  I had said I would be interested in the opportunity, but I never accepted the position.  

I mentioned to two of my my superiors, one being the owner of the company, that I would like to discuss the opportunity further but I had questions about some of the expectations of the new role.  

After 3.5 months, there was no further discussion, and no change in my role, nor was I offered a contract to sign. However, I just received my first full paycheck for this year, and it was significantly less than I thought I was going to receive.  I keep track of my time based on a company mandated punch card and I was expecting a large amount of overtime pay from the amount of hours I have put in the past few weeks.  

I had already ran the numbers based on my pay from the previous years as well as the hypothetical salary I was offered, and I determined I would be taking an incredible pay cut with my new position.  

My main issue is, my role has not changed in the slightest.  I have done the same work I have always done, but my pay structure changed.  This will result in a pay decrease of almost $16k this year based off my W2s for 2019, with no added benefits to compensate for this loss of income.

Is this legal to change someone’s pay structure without a contract?  Other than update my resumé, what other steps/resources can I use to combat this?"

legaladvice,Low battery smoke deter chirping in unoccupied apartment in the building next door,"The apartment building next door might be what people consider a slum (I’m not sure, but it could be in better shape). One of the units has been unoccupied for a while and about two weeks ago the smoke detector started chirping at night, the kind of chirp that signals a low battery. Typically low temperatures as night reduce battery voltage, so smoke dry it’s chirp at night but not after the temperatures rise in the day. Today I finally figured out where the chirping was coming from and I was able to get the email of the landlord. However, I’m trying to prepare in case the landlord takes no action. Besides contacting them, what other course of action is viable to get someone to stop the chirping. Do I email the city, if so what department? Do I call non emergency number for the fire department? (Is that a thing?) Thanks for any help.
The city is Los Angeles, California


Edit: in case anyone finds this post. I called the fire department and they said they couldn’t do anything about it. I was able to find the listing for the unoccupied unit and call the listing agent. They agreed to go over and fix it but we’ll see if they actually do."
legaladvice,Fiance's ex-wife keeps trying to guilt money out of Fiance,"We're looking into lawyers at the moment through ottowa county of Michigan, which is where their child support is though though neither live in the area, but just wanting to get an idea of what to deal with.

Fiance and his ex-wife seperated a couple years back, they have 2 kids together to which she has physical custody. He is always on time with child support, and has even helped her on occasion financially because she would use the kids as emotional leverage.

Broke her phone? well she can't afford a new one so if he wants to talk to the kids he'll buy her one (he gave her his old one and got himself a new one)Backpacks, shoes, clothes, ect., always a hand out for cash, i suggested he have her send him links for things and he'll order them for the kids, though with the amount he pays in child support, it should certainly be covering more than enough of this.He'll send money for occassional things like taking the kids out for icecream and things of that nature.

The issue here is that his work has shipped him overseas for a year, for a custody agreement to which he has half custody but currently cannot see the kids physically. Instead he communicates with them via video calls, phone calls, ect. There is probably a difference in the amount he should be contributing with the current work situation/visitation, but if there is a difference, he has well paid it in all the 'extras' he's given over the timeframe of being gone, and the whole reason he took the job was the better pay to try and fight for physical custody when he returns.

Now exwife has blocked him from talking or seeing the kids because he has refused to give her extra money to buy a car now that her car broke down. Threatening that the kids will end up in foster care, ect, because she can't afford to get a new car if he doesn't help pay for it.

He does have her admitting to blocking him from talking to or seeing the kids recorded on text message, and this isn't the first time she's blocked him out of the kids life if he does something she doesn't approve, including not allowing his visitation when he was stateside on leave because I was also around, so she took the kids for that time and disappeared and refused contact.

What should we do for this situation, with him being oversea's? What CAN we do, legal wise, to allow him access to his kids, and is there anything that doesn't have to be a long wait on court/lawyers?"
legaladvice,"I received a pay cut at my job without warning, but my boss is claiming otherwise. Unsure of how to approach this.","Throwaway account for private reasons. Ive worked at a small local business in Wisconsin for the past 2 1/2 years if that will be of any help to the situation.

There has also been severe animosity towards myself and another coworker with my boss since mid-Dec of last year during our yearly employee meeting when we found out he had been stealing our tips and we confronted him about it in a very respectful manner, to which he immediately began yelling, we were threatened with making a serving wage (even though we are not a full service restaurant, we are technically fast food) and overall treated with the lowest amount of respect. Ever since he’s been doing the most he can to make our lives hell, essentially. I’m not too well-versed on the laws of these types of things so I’m just weighing my options here.

Basically what the title says - I came to work today and opened my check to see that my pay had been cut 25 cents. I asked my boss, who happened to be there this morning, if he cut my pay. He told me yes. I asked him if he was planning on informing me about it. He claims that he had told me in December, the day after the employee meeting we had. This is 100% untrue. He came into work that day and told my co-worker that she was being demoted from manager to a normal employee and that her pay was going to be cut. He never gave her an amount. He also cut hers before her next paycheck, which I know is not legal.

The only thing he said to me was that I was not going to be doing the scheduling anymore, and that my nose piercings needed to be taken out (which I know was just a personal attack since they had never been a problem before that instance). My pay was never discussed.

Since then, Dec. 16th, my last two paychecks have been my normal amount, and suddenly I walk in today with a pay cut that I was “supposedly” told about a month ago, but was never put in action. I told him my last 2 checks were still my normal pay amount and he tells me that he just didn’t put it in until now. I also was not informed why I was receiving a pay cut; the only thing I had done was add up the money during the meeting which we used to figure out our tips were not accurate.

Since this is a privately-owned small business I’m not even sure if there’s anything I can do about this, especially without solid proof, but any advice would be appreciated. 

And if anyone asks: The personal job search is in full effect, just difficult since I have health issues which makes this current job very convenient for me. But I’m getting pushed to my limits here with the things going on in this place for spiteful reasons.

TLDR: Work at a privately owned business. Boss claims that I was informed of a pay cut over a month ago when I was not. Last two paychecks have been my normal amount. I walk in today and my pay has been cut 25 cents. He says he just never put it in until now. I have no proof that he never discussed this with me. Is there anything I can do about this?

legaladvice,"[IA] A friend owes $200 and will not pay back, agreement was verbal","Posting this for a friend of mine who doesn’t have a Reddit but is looking for advice. If anyone has questions I’ll have her answer them.

She bought herself and a friend tickets and VIP passes to an out-of-state concert a few months ago. They backed out and she asked around for anyone who wanted to go with her under the condition they pay her, it was $100 per ticket. That’s when this friend, we’ll call them Mike, said he could go with her. He agreed to pay her back and said it was no problem… over Facetime.

She drove them to the concert and back. While they were there Mike saw some merch in the venue he wanted and my friend said she could cover the cost for now if he gave her the money when he got paid. She also got him snacks and stuff at a gas station, again contingent on him paying her back. It all added up to $200 and she let him know that.

Fast forward a few weeks, she hasn’t heard from Mike. She texts him and just tries to make conversation to see if he’ll mention when he’ll pay her back. He literally does not reply to her. A few days later, she asks directly about the money and she did it again a couple weeks after that, only asking more bluntly for the money back. He hasn’t sent her one text back.

She’s been hopeful he’ll pay her back eventually because they’ve been friends for a while and she doesn’t want to do anything drastic, but today, she Retweeted a Tweet on Twitter that was a joke about being owed money. He liked this Tweet and then when she checked his profile, he’d blocked her. She’s pretty upset now and realizing she’s never going to see it.

The main problem is that this was all a spoken agreement, nothing happened through text so she’s not sure if she has any mode of legal recourse to get her money back. It isn’t a large amount but she’s a broke college student. Will small claims court even be an option? Thank you to anyone that has any advice."

legaladvice,"Two Companies Disagree about Insurance start date and I might have to pay $15,000","Hi all, I'll try to keep personal and professional info out of this post.

So I am a recent college grad who just landed my first job that gives me insurance benefits so I can get off of my father's plan. (Yay, I thought) I also have a rare autoimmune disease that requires some infusion treatments.

Let's call my father's insurance company Insurance A, and let's call my work's insurance company Insurance B.

I started my job on June 10th, but did not sign up for their insurance plan until July 2nd.

I got an infusion treatment on June 27th of last year. Because I had not signed up for new insurance I didn't change my insurance info at the hospital (I mean what would I change it to?)

For some reason, even though I signed up on July 2nd, Insurance B back dated my coverage to my work start date June 10th (before the treatment).

Now Insurance A is saying they don't have to pay the bill because I had coverage from Insurance B, but Insurance B is saying they don't have to pay the bill because I didn't alert the hospital to a change in insurance before treatment.

Am I fucked? Are they allowed to just back date insurance like that from before you signed up and then deny any claims that could be made for treatment in that interim? Do I have any recourse or do I have to pay the $15,000 that 500 mL of medicine apparently costs (more than twice the cost of my car!)

I'm grateful for any advice you all can give, I am just starting out and figuring out insurance.

legaladvice,What is the legal term for a scenario where the Employer forges a title to serve his employee a non-renewal letter? Please read for details (not long I promise),"Scenario details:

Employer needs to have title ""XYZ"" in order to serve his employee a non-renewal letter.

Employer was applying for title ""XYZ"".

Employer was not approved until 3 months after he served his employee a letter stating he was not going to be renewed.

Problem is Employer signed with title ""XYZ"" convincing the recipient employee that he indeed possessed such title and authority.

Later the employee discovered this title ""XYZ"" was not approved until 3 months after the letter was served to him.

Does this not invalidate the non-renewal letter? Also, can the employee press charges for forgery and what are the legal words or descriptors for what just happened?"
legaladvice,"[NYS] Lease says it is tenant's responsibility to shovel snow for private entrance, but landlord also uses walkway (thus not private).","Hi all,

So I live in Buffalo NY in a multi-family home, my landlord lives on the first two floors and we rent the third floor. We use the side entrance that gets us up to our apartment and there's a sidewalk from the side entrance all the way to the street. Here is what our lease says:

""If your apartment is in a one or two family house or if apartment has its own private or separate entrance, the tenant is responsible for his or her own snow and ice removal for his means of egress or exit, including porch, stairs and walkways. Tenant will supply their own supplies to accommodate this and tenant will hold landlord harmless for their failure to maintain this area.""

So typically my roommate and I just wear snow boots that can barrel through the snow so we don't have to shovel. It's my understanding that its our responsibility to shovel if this is a private entrance, however if we don't want to we don't have to? My landlord claims this is a private entrance but the sidewalk that the side door connects to is also connected to her back gate and she takes her dogs out that way. Wouldn't that mean that it's not a private entrance thus not our responsibility?

She scolded me today because it wasn't shoveled and she had some guys carrying something in for her.

legaladvice,"School insists I pay erroneous application fee in their system from 13 years ago and refuses to process my 2019 application until I pay it, even though I have paid the 2019 application fee.","I’m attempting to further my education and so have applied to a school I had applied to 13 years ago and had been accepted to but could not attend. When I signed in to the application website to complete my application for the 2020-2021 academic year, not only was my old account still active, but I was surprised to see a notice indicating that I owed an application fee. I had already paid the application fee for the current application so I contacted the school, and was even more shocked to learn that the supposedly outstanding application fee was from 2007. I believe this is actually in error and that I either paid the 2007 application fee at the time or had received a fee waiver because the application had been processed. Regardless, the state the school is in, California, has a statute of limitations of 4 years on these types of debts, so any debt from 2007 should have expired in 2011.

I explained all of this to the school but they still insist that I must pay the application fee from 2007 or provide proof that I either paid it previously or received a fee waiver or they will not process my current application even though I paid the processing fee for this year.

The bank account and card I would have paid with in 2007 are long gone, as are the statements for those accounts, and the school apparently does not keep records of fee waivers. I can, however, prove that I would have qualified for a fee waiver in 2007, but they won’t honor this proof.

legaladvice,"Is this legally enforceable? (Animal adoption contract, North Carolina)","State: North Carolina

So this local horse rescue contract spells out a bunch of insane stipulations like ""you can never use the horse for commercial purposes"" (read: let students ride it for lessons if you happen to teach lessons for extra cash, like a ton of horse owners do, because they are not cheap to take care of!) and ""we have access to your property at any time and can seize the horse for any reason.""

This is the part that's really getting me:

"" If contract is breached in any way by adopter/caregiver they agree to pay $5000 to ((rescue name)) to cover costs associated with retrieving horse or medical care including but not limited to: veterinary/rehab care, recovery of horse, attorneys fees, expenses of litigation and any other costs incurred.""

The market value of most of these horses is between $500 and $1000. This seems unenforceable to me, like they can't just arbitrarily demand 5-10x the market value of the animal because you taught a riding lesson on it. Am I wrong? I'm trying to help them rehome the horse I currently have fostered for them (because it's been a year and a half and I'm done paying bills for a horse I don't own), but NO ONE will sign this insane adoption contract, for obvious reasons.

legaladvice,(CA) Public School Athletic Facilities,"(Main question at the bottom, as most of the text is just background information)

Up until a few months ago, I coached at a public school in California.  I had a less-than-average relationship with the Athletic Director (AD), but I was in generally good standing with the school up until last season.  He brought in a different coach at the same level as me, we were supposed to be Co-Head Coaches, but he greatly favored my peer due to do the AD always looking down on me, likely due to my younger age.

Throughout the season, I put in many complaints about my Co-Head Coach because I felt like he was disrespecting the students -- not being about to build a workout plan that was suitable for students physical abilities, being unnecessarily threatening verbally and with body language, and being generally dismissive of other priorities outside of the sport.  This situation obviously lead to a lot  of under-the-surface tension, but we finished out the season together.  At the conclusion of last year, I was effectively informed that I would not be rehired, as coaches in our district are under short-term contracts.  I didn't want to pursue any legal action on this part, as it pretty much is one of those situations that sucks and you have to move on, but the other coach still feels threatened by me because the students see me in a much more favorable light compared to him -- literally 10-15 varsity, athlete, out of 20, complaints directly to the administration about the other coach.  In the end, I wasn't charged with misconduct of any sort nor I was fired.  They just sort of let me expire in a way.

I wanted to give a background on why my relationship with the school is so contentious, but my inquiry is based more on my rights as a citizen.  It is my understanding that the school's athletic facilities were, in part, publicly funded by the city and are open to the public as long as school is not in session or there is no conflicting game or practice on that facility.  There are signs posted along the lines of ""This area is closed to the general public during school hours from 8 AM to 3:30 PM,"" which I felt implied public use is okay outside of those times. 

I met up with a former fellow coach during one of her non-school related practices, as she runs her own private coaching business apart from the school and is able to use the facilities as long as it follows the details above.  The Athletic Director eventually found out I was present on the field, and forced me to leave.  I felt like I was compliant with their restrictions, as I was there when other non-school affiliated persons were allowed, there was no conflicting practice, nor was there any practice held by my former Co-Head Coach at the time, so there really shouldn't have been any disruption at all.

My question is do they have a right to kick me out, as it's not fully a public space, or do I have the right to freely assemble there?"

legaladvice,[California] Classroom recording of unbecoming incident,"Someone close to me is a teacher in a Title 1 school district in California. She teaches an elementary school class for students with disabilities at a public elementary school. She is one of the most caring and selfless people I know going so far as spending thousands a year to make sure her students have the food and materials they need and she has taught without incident for several years. She deals with a lot, it is not uncommon for a student to strip naked, need to be taken back to the bathroom to wipe properly or for her have to shutdown her class, escort the rest of her students to another classroom while one of her students has a tantrum destroying the whole classroom and endangering themselves. The teachers in her program have many methods specifically suited to the students for teaching them empathy, basic social and hygiene skills, and safely restraining them if it seems as if they might harm themselves or their classmates.    


Recently one of her students shredded a book belonging to another teacher threw it on the ground and stomped on it. In not one of her best moments she grabbed the students snack, a candy bar, and stomped on it to mirror to the student his actions. Now the student in question is on the low functioning side, he is mostly non-verbal and laughs at inappropriately harmful things including self harm and he is hard to reach. Now my friend knows this isn't her best moment and she deeply regrets doing this but it is likely a litigious mother of another of her students has been recording the classroom with a hidden recorder on her child, recorded the incident and told the student in questions father.

The father set up a meeting with the school's principal and the two teachers present, is very angry and is claiming that his child is ""scarred for life"". Considering the child's past behavior this is exceedingly unlikely. The principal stood up for the two teachers including my friend who explained that they were roll playing and they always have more snacks in the classroom. My friend is not only worried that she'll get fired she's worried about the recording making its way to the news and is therefore seriously considering resigning. 

If anyone can shed some light on the factors at play or give advice on how to proactively approach this situation be it through her teacher's union or school administration it would be greatly appreciated."

There was other factors to her moving out but that was the last one. After the argument she moved out (very close to the oldest sons school) and started picking him up after school. I would pick him up from her place after my classes. I helped her move all of her belongings into her new place, and tonight she called and told us that he would be staying there from now on and we could see him on weekends and school breaks.

legaladvice,Reprinting a comic for personal use,"To start, I am US, with comics company being an international company with a headquarters in CT. The printer is also US based. 

I am working on binding a collection of comics that I have for my own collection. However, I have found that the page size was made smaller in the latter half of the run. As I would hate to have to trim my larger issues to match the page size of the smaller ones, I am curious as to the legality of having these smaller sized issues reprinted from pdf copies onto a larger size by a third party company that specializes in comic printing.

These reprints would purely be for personal use as part of my bound collection, which I have no plans to sell. I contacted the original company that published the comics and the response I got leads me to think that it may fall under fair use, as I don’t want them for profit reasons. However, since it would be a third party printing it, I don’t want there to be trouble because I would be paying them to print them. 

Any advice would be most helpful.

Edit: it has come to my attention that this would not fall under fair use. I was mistaken as to what fair use means. Rather, it seems that it may fall under the comic company’s Fair Play policy, which is unrelated to fair use."

legaladvice,Contractor extorting me for my building permits,"TL;DR - paid a guy 650 to ""expedite"" my permits, and run them to county. After a year of delays, he is now charging me for the hours he worked, at 65$ an hour, a number that was never agreed to or mentioned. He wont provide them until I pay.

California

I am in the process of trying to build a home. Our Architect recommended a guy to run our blueprints to the county for approval, saying that doing so would expedite the process, and that his fee was 650.  My wife and I have friends in the industry, and would have been able to run them ourselves, but for such a reasonable price, we figured why wouldn't we. We were told the process should take 3-4 months. We write the 650$ check, give it to the plan runner, and things begin. We never got an invoice for the 650, and our dumbasses never got anything in writing.

A year after submittal, and many delays (Which I would argue are at the very least 50% due to our runner not being clear on what was required), our grading permit is approved, and my plan runnersends a 600 dollar extension fee from the county for our house plans, which now need to be pulled by June, otherwise we have to start this whole process over, which will cost at the very least another 5,000. House plans can not be pulled until grading is complete and approved.

An hour after I get this $600 dollar extension fee from the runner, I am also sent his itemized bill for all of the hours he has spent getting our plans approved, that amounts to 1,100, with half of the ""retainer"" we paid him removed from this bill. This being the very first time I have been informed that he was working hourly, and that his hourly rate was over $60 an hour. (this number does not include the current work he has done on getting the house plans approved)

I have a phone call with him, where I explain that I wasn't aware the work he was doing was being charged hourly, that in no time in the last year, after countless text messages and multiple phone calls, was it ever brought up that our initial fee was only a retainer, nor was it mentioned whent he hours he worked had passed the retainer. I asked him if he, or the architect could provide me with ANYTHING in the past year mentioning any of this, and if they could I have absolutely no problem paying the fee. He says that I was told in a meeting with the architect at the end of 2018, and that I am basically lying because I wasn't expecting it to be this much. I explained my frustrations with him over the things that were missed, the fees we have now had to pay due to the delays, etc. and felt that the fee he was charging was unfair. He offered to only charge 1250, and then call it even. I asked for him to remove the other half of the retainer from that amount (320), he got frustrated and hung up. After the phone call, I talked it over with my wife, and we decided we would just take what he offered, and finished the plan running ourselves, and be done with it.

He sends an email 2 hours later, that is basically ""firing"" us as a client, and demanding we pay him in full for everything he has done, which amounts to about $1,700. So now he wants current payment in full, for work he wont even complete (at this point, he has about 2-3 hours left to run for the house plans, and if we are in for this much we might as well freaking pay it to get it done). He will not reconsider, and accept the 1,250 he offered previously, due to my rudeness in countering his offer, and that I am lucky he isn't billing me for the countless phone calls and text messages over the last year (I literally went through my call logs with him, and in 13 months it amounts to 55 minutes worth of calltime).

My dilemma is he has my permits, and I can't do shit without them. My grader is still a couple weeks out, so I can't do anything with the permits until then, but I need to have them by that time, so we can move things forward before plans expire.

Am I in the wrong here? I honestly wish he could have provided me correspondence showing I overlooked his fee, so I could just pay it, and not feel like I was cheated. This amount in the grand scheme of things is going to just be a drop in the bucket, but the feeling that this guy is fucking me over is just driving me up the wall. If I did pay his full amount that he is demanding, would I have any recourse against him after the fact? I can't go after him legally right now, because by the time it is settled, my plans will be expired."
legaladvice,We (plaintiff) are in civil litigation now and the defendant is refusing to provide anything for Discovery,"Backstory: we are a family owned hemp farm in CO. We contracted with a processor to process our harvest in Jan ‘19. Halfway through the job they told us they couldn’t finish all of what we gave them for various reasons and withheld our split.  They acknowledged several times they owed us but not what we required. After unsuccessful attempts at communication we hired an attorney and proceeded with litigation. Defendant refused to provide receipts for proof of sales as required by Discovery, fired his attorney, asked our attorney for two extensions and finally facing sanctions, advised our attorney he had nothing to provide as the company doesn’t exist anymore. Sure enough check on SOS and he voluntarily dissolved the company we are suing 2 weeks ago (he’s got another one that is active). Now our attorney is advising us to file new lawsuits against his other DBAs. We are well beyond settlement at this point. What is our recourse for someone simply refusing to provide ANY proof of sales, transferring &amp; hiding assets who is or potentially will file bankruptcy and who is willfully creating extra expense for us due to never ending extension requests?

Frustrated, my aunt just said “oh just do it” and he is blackmailing her with that screenshot and he says that if she does anything, he will go to the police and tell them that she has invited him to killing himself.

From what I know, this guy is psychologically abusive and yes, psycho. One time he made a fake Facebook with my aunts photo and started adding most of my family. Im not sure why he would do this. (Psycho I guess) the profile got taken down because we reported it.

Today he commented on one of my public posts I had shared about a lost dog. He said gibberish and added a mugshot of my cousin (my aunts daughter, which I had no idea) I quickly erased the comment and called her to let her know. I told her that she should file a police report or a restraining order but she says that it won’t do anything. He is crazy and is trying to hurt her image.

legaladvice,"[SF, California] Roommates trying to bind us to a sublease agreement. Demanding extra rent. What are our options?","SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

**Context:** I recently moved in with my SO temporarily, who lives with 3 other roommates, until I figure out my job situation so we can move out together. SO + another roommate are currently subleasing, while 2 others are the master tenants who signed their names to the apartment. When she moved in, SO agreed to written rent and utilities terms. Master tenants verbally expressed house rules. SO did not sign any agreements regarding these rules and was not given a copy of the master tenants' lease agreement with the landlord. 

**Fast forward:** Recently, I moved into the apartment without letting master tenants know in advanced. They're disappointed about no prior warning and want to charge us ""back rent"" and extra rent for me being an additional occupant through their own sublease agreement that they wrote up. We think the amount is too high and they aren't budging with negotiations. 

The master lease agreement states that no additional tenants are allowed unless the landlord be notified - something we had only learned recently upon being shared the document.

Can we claim ignorance? Are we being strong armed into signing a sublease agreement? Is it worth going to small claims court? What are our options?

Both parties were at fault - master tenants did not explicitly share the dwelling terms of the apartment and us thinking it was OK since I'd stay over often and the master tenants hadn't expressed any issues.

Please ask any clarifying questions if I'm not painting the whole picture."

**Last year I got a speeding ticket in San Francisco, and I'm going to fight it in court. Here are the details:**

Cited for going &lt;20mph over the speed limit on Highway 1 in San Francisco by SFPD (NOT CHP).

At my arraignment (sometime in Nov. 2019), I chose NOT to waive my right to a speedy trial. Trial was booked for 12/26/2019.

A week before my trial, I got a letter from the court stating that my trial had been pushed back to 2/3/2020 per the officer's request.

I was just told that I may be able to get out of my ticket via ""speedy trial law"" due to my trial being pushed out beyond the 45 day period following my arraignment. Is this true? and would I have to go to the court beforehand and submit some kind of form, or do I just appear in court on my trial date and use this as my defense?

The skinny - I am a graduate student living in a house with 2 other people currently. One of the roommates, Y, and I have lived together well for the past two years on the property. The third roommate, X, has only lived here for this current lease, and for various reasons (invasion of privacy/possible theft, issues with being flaky about bills and rent, serious anger issues, constant excuses, etc.) Y and I have decided that it's not going to continue to work out for this roommate to stay on for the next lease.

What I'm trying to figure out is if Y and I can legally just ask our landlord to re-up the lease with the two of us, sans X, (whether or not X wants to stay) or if this would be problematic/illegal. Or also, if X decides just to \*not leave\* after the lease, where that would leave Y and I. I've been googling around and can't seem to find anything helpful or specific. We're hoping to have a sit down to explain to the third roommate that we'd like them to leave once we have more info on our options. If all goes well, they just decide to go peacefully, but we'd like to cover our bases in case they decide to go nuclear and refuse to find other places after the current lease is up.

I'm trying to find answers or resources that can explain our legal options. I'm already going to my student legal services office to get help, but also would like to be able to read up a little bit on my own for answers. I'm happy to be more specific and answer questions as well!

legaladvice,"[Michigan] Girlfriend signed her name on lease, thought she backed out and finds out yesterday that the Apartment Company is expecting security deposit and lease application payments soon and to otherwise cancel will require 250 dollars from her (as stated in the lease agreement).","So I'm going to help clarify what the title exactly means with details.

My girlfriend on October 11th was looking for housing next year and visited a nearby apartment complex.  She found an apartment she liked, and they said that she can sign the application and lease, but not pay the required application fee; so if she decides not to get the apartment, then the forms she signs is null and void after 3 days, and the apartment would be back on the market.  She asked the person assisting her what she would have to do if she decided to not get the apartment, and he said nothing.  You don't have to even come in to our office.  During this, she took notes on her phone and repeated questions to make sure they weren't missing any details.  She signed the application and lease, and was not given a copy of either forms.

A couple days later her roommate checks out the apartment, doesn't like it, so they let the 3 day period pass thinking that the apartment will go back on the market as promised.

Yesterday my girlfriend receives an email stating that she needs to pay for her application fees (they charged her twice despite signing only one form) and security/""reservation"" deposit.  Confused, she replies that she was told that the apartment contract had been cancelled and that she doesn't understand why they are contacting her months later. A reply states that per the leasing agreement, cancellation after the three days of signing will require a $250 cancellation fee (due to advertisement costs, showing her the apartment, etc.), and that the apartment agents are well versed in the contract, insinuating that their employees do not make mistakes. 

We both show up the next day, but the smaller leasing office where she had signed was now closed (there are many complexes near each other, so there are multiple leasing offices per apartment grouping), and so we went to the main leasing office.  We pose as a couple looking for an apartment in order to verify their typical lease signing procedure.  The lady confirmed that an application along with a payment is required before the lease is considered, but right now they are doing a promotion where the application fee isn't needed.  She also correctly informed us about the 3 day termination period  on the lease which required a $250 cancellation fee after 3 days of signing the lease: something my girlfriend was not told when she was looking at their apartments.  Then we explained our real reason for coming, to which the lady was very apologetic for what happened, and went back to get her managers. 

Then we got to speak with the administrative assistant who had sent yesterday's worrying email.  She tells us now that she believes that there WAS a miscommunication/mistake, BUT that the $250 dollars is still required per the lease agreement.  The administrative assistant had also talked to the property manager and he had requested the $250 be paid.  My girlfriend decided to sign their termination form just so that the apartment is back on the market, and she asked them to give her a copy of all the forms she has signed so far.  My girlfriend looked at the application form and saw that the entire administrative section including ""Terms of Acceptance"" was blank (application approved/denied (circle one), approved by\_\_, person notifying applicant\_\_).  It also states that an application payment is required before even receiving a lease (my girlfriend had paid them nothing).  Then when receiving her lease form, she sees that the landlord forgot to put the date with their signature.

We have not yet revealed these details to the leasing office, and are hoping for any advice on how to approach this further.  I don't understand how my girlfriend was allowed to keep the lease without even paying for the lease application form, and are they contacting her now because of their current promotion (not needing to pay the application fee to get an apartment). I understand that a lease is a binding contract but I believe the circumstances trump the obligations."

legaladvice,"Trying to Break my Lease Early, Need Clarification.","Hello!!  


I am currently residing in Utah and trying to break my lease early in order to move into a house that I am in the process of purchasing.  I was looking through my lease agreement and have a question on what the following would mean.  Our landlord made it seem like we would have to pay way more than the lease agreement states for early termination. I do not think it matters because I do not have any orders, but I am also in the military if there is any way out it regarding that.

  
**12. OPTION FOR EARLY TERMINATION:**  Resident is expected to remain a Resident for the entire term specified in the Lease.  If Resident fails to do so, Resident will be responsible to Landlord for all damages provided by law, including (but not limited to) rent due through the end of the contract term, minus rents paid by a replacement resident (if any). This amount will vary depending upon how long it takes Landlord to find a replacement resident and cannot be determined in advance of move-out as it is typically impossible to estimate. 

To avoid this uncertainty, Resident may choose to exercise an Early Termination Option. Resident understands and acknowledges that Landlord is not legally obligated to allow early termination of the Lease unless provided for pursuant to statutory or common law. Moreover, any agreement for Early Termination of Lease shall constitute an informal resolution of Resident's claim for the anticipatory or actual breach of the Lease in consideration for the conditions set forth below, which Resident must deliver to the Landlord:

i. A written notice stating that Resident has elected to exercise the Early Termination Option;  
ii. An early termination option payment of **2 month's rent, $2,822.00**;  
iii. An executed agreement for repayment of concessions (if applicable, see Concessions Section); and  
iv. Payment of rent and other amounts due through the new Lease end date.

When Landlord has (1) received the written notice and the Early Termination Option payment and (2) signed and agreed to the notice, the Lease end date will be amended. The new Lease end date will be the date specified in the notice which must be at least **sixty (60)** days after the written election and payment are given to the Landlord. Exercise of the Early Termination Option will affect only Resident's rent obligations after the new Lease end date. Resident must comply with all other Lease Obligations.

The way I am interpreting this is that I would only need to pay the early termination option in order to break my lease early.  The landlord is stating that I would need to pay for the early termination option and the **60 (sixty)** days stated above.  
Thank you in advance for your help."

legaladvice,Spain: Man leaves house in shambles after renting it. Was growing Marijuana in the garage and had illegal connections to the electricity system.,"This is actually 2 questions in one, so first:

We were renting out a house to a guy in Spain, seemed like an upstanding guy but was hard to contact and wouldn’t let us in and pretend he wasn’t home (in hindsight, we should have noticed something was off but anyway) 

Long story short, the house was in terrible shape, needed hundreds of thousands in repairs (walls repainted, broken sinks replaced, pipes replaced, furniture replaced and a bunch of other things). And we have quite good reason to believe he was growing Marijuana in the garage (we found a bag of weed, multiple burner phones, and a shopping list with multiple industrial grade airing systems among other things.)

So the first question would be, what can we legally do? We don’t know a lot about him, except that he probably is in the UK now. Is there any way to sue or is it a lost case?


And the second and more important question:  Because he had illegal connections to the electricity system, our electricity company has cut us off completely. We have tried explaining that we weren’t at fault but they just keep saying we need to pay 28 grand. We’re trying to go to court but they just aren’t picking up the case and to be honest I believe that the electric company is behind it. The longer people need to wait, the higher the chance that they’ll pay. Wouldn’t be the shadiest thing happening in Spain. But I’m getting off-topic. We also can’t change company because they control the cables in our area. 

So the second question, what are our options here? We’d really need to sell the house rather sooner than later which isn’t possible while there is no electricity.

Any help is appreciated!

I don't know what to do, because I made an agreement with them and I paid what they asked.

legaladvice,Mortgage lender bait and switch,"As the title states, I feel as if I've gotten the bait and switch from my mortgage lender. We found a house we liked and got quotes from 3 mortgage lenders. We decided to go with 1 because costs to close were around 12-13k with a good rate compared to 24-26k with the other lenders.

Fast forward into the process, they send the loan to underwriting and schedule the appraisal. The next day the mortgage lender sends me an email stating that my loan parameters have changed(LTV, and CLTV), and the costs to close have increased by 12-14k. Not only do I not have this extra amount of money to close, but I feel like I got baited and switched, they quoted me one loan, but changed after underwriting.

Immediately after receiving their email on Thursday, I replied "" Send me a new loan estimate before I proceed with anything."" She never sent me one, and kept trying to explain themselves out of the huge change in loans instead. This Tuesday I ask for it again, and still will not supply me with one because of ""computer errors"" now.

Yesterday Wednesday I sent them an email stating I would like to cancel their business. They reply that the appraisal is back and are sad to see im going. Even though I asked them not to proceed with anything. So now I'm on the hook for a 750$ appraisal fee and a 395$ loan fee.

Do I have recourse to get this money refunded since they changed the parameters of the loan, and they also proceeded with the appraisal after I told them to not proceed anything?

Location: Oregon

 EDIT: The parameters that changed were the CLTV and LTV. They quoted us for a regular conventional loan when they were supposed to follow the parameters of the LIFT program we are doing which is 95%CLTV max."

legaladvice,I overdosed for the first time today... after being over 1 month clean. Need legal advice/guidance [VA]," o obviously the correct answer to whatever I am going to say next is to hire a lawyer. I am looking into that now. And also I understand everyone on here is NAL, or at least not performing in that role right now.

But in the meantime, I was hoping someone could shed some light on my situation by sharing their own experiences or knowledge.

Basically, after being clean for a month I overdosed on fentadope. My friend called the EMT and the police showed up as well. I was taken away on the gurney to the hospital while my friend stayed behind. I guess the cops talked to him and asked if he had any drugs on him, and he gave them the used rig he had. They also went through my bag that was left while I was taken away, and I guess they found somewhere between .2-.5 of fentadope. The cops later came into my room at the ER and asked if I wanted to talk to a detective as it might help my case. I asked what case, and they said they didn't know and couldn't give me any details. So I told them I was sorry, but I was not interested in talking to them.

Another cop came in later and basically said the same thing. When I said I didn't want to talk to the detective, he said ""ok, I guess you know the drill. We are sending the stuff we found to the lab and then a warrant."" - Maybe I misheard, but that is very close to what it sounded like.

So I should basically expect to be charged with at least drug possession correct? How about possession of paraphernalia even though it was in my friends possession? Anything I could have done to improve the outcome of these encounters? Was it worth talking to the detective there, or was I right to wait until I have found a lawyer? And if they do come with the charges I listed, should I just expect police to come to my house or work one day and arrest me ?

And I guess final question, is this post too specific to my case that I should delete it to avoid self-incrimination? I am sure there are plenty of overdoses that happen in VA everyday, but if there is a general consensus towards deleting it, I would rather be safe than sorry."

legaladvice,American coming back from long-term stay in China. What are my rights against being detained at the airport?,"LOCATION: FLORIDA, USA

I have been living in China for the past year, amongst all the issues with the Wuhan virus, I worry that when I arrive back in the states they may detain us to check if we are contagious (fine by me). Where the potential issue arises is with my lack of health insurance or money to pay for the initial testing. Another concern is; if I do happen to contract the virus, I would not be able to afford the procedure, and facility rental to follow my quarantine. Do I have any rights to avoid paying for this? Am I able to withhold my SSN or any other identifiable (billable) information from the medical staff?

My goal is not to infect others, and I will, of course, comply with any sort of testing they find necessary to ensure I am not infectious.

legaladvice,[SC] Protection for tenants who are in danger of domestic abuse?,"(Obligatory “I’m-on-mobile, sorry for the formatting” warning)

I am currently 4 months into a 12 month lease in South Carolina. Both my boyfriend and I are on the lease. Recently, however, he has been drinking to excess regularly, and putting both myself and our shared animals in danger. I have not called the police, nor have any of our neighbors, even though his screaming has definitely warranted it on multiple occasions. I’ve “threatened” to kick him out for this behavior multiple times but he always claims that he has 30 days to vacate if I act on it, which is obviously far too long to wait if he’s actively being abusive on a nightly basis. Please don’t suggest that I leave, as I currently have nowhere to go and animals that I am the sole carer for. 

Does South Carolina have any protective measures in place for victims of abuse in these scenarios, such as allowing only one person to be removed from the lease? I’ve been able to find resources online referencing statutes others states have, such as Wisconsin allowing for landlords to remove specific tenants from a lease if a no-contact or restraining order has been put into place.  I would simply call the police during one of his outbursts but our lease has a clause that all parties *can* be evicted for the cops being called to the premises. 

I am simply looking for the best route to take to ensure the safety of both myself and my animals. I need to know the best course of action to take to make this as non-painful as possible, as the situation itself has already taken an insane toll on my mental and physical health."
legaladvice,My less than minimum wage job told me that I owe them money for training me if I quit,"The culture is toxic, the hours promised are not what I got, the shifts are irregular and they expect you to cover within a moments notice (like 5 minutes notice). I also believe that they were dishonest in their   Scheduling since I ended up being forced to work hours and days  that I never applied for. Supposed to be 40 hours but I tend to work 21 hours, 15 hours 31 hours etc. you get it, wildly variable hours so I can barely make ends meet. They do not pay us for administrative work which ends up taking over 30 minutes per session. If a client is late, we do not get paid for any of that time. Our managers get these little tantrums when we cannot cover shifts for people within the drop of a hat, change our schedules and rarely respect schedule changes. 

The training is mandatory within a given time period upon hiring, I completed mine quite quickly. I never once saw repayment terms in the hiring contract. 

I should have seen the red flags. I have a better opportunity that is more stable, pays more and I get to work from home so I really want to leave. 

I do not plan on seeking employment within the similar field plus they are using an average amount of hours to claim back the money for training if I quit. And that amount is what I usually make in two weeks of working with them. 

I want out but they are holding me hostage with this absurd amount of money they pulled out of the thin air. I don’t get paid enough to care.

On a different note, they were sued for fraudulent insurance claims and had to pay a settlement. They claim they did not do it but I have proof that they go against ethical standards set by the agency that oversees this particular field."

legaladvice,Robbery VS Theft,"So, my fiance was arrested on a Robbery 1 charge in the state of Oregon.

My fiance is being accused of getting in the vehicle, starting it with the key that was left inside the vehicle and when the owner of the vehicle saw his truck pulling away, he ran outside and jumped off the vehicle, getting knocked off. This ended up leading to a high speed chase and ultimately he was arrested. So, my question is, how is the a Robbery charge instead of a theft charge since it wasn't forcefully taken and there was no threat? Also how does the court determine if someone that stole something was planning on returning it? And do courts usually take into consideration if someone was on very strong pain medicine from a recent major surgery and obviously they would not have been in a correct state of mind?"

My daughter is just doing the free VPK, we don’t need wrap around so we’re not paying any fees... So we just applied at my two older children’s school. The school is Charter school. It’s a free public school, but you have to apply and be part of a lottery to attend. Once your oldest is in, the younger are guaranteed a spot the following year. We’ve been at this school for 5 years now... 

So the head of the VPK for the school just left me a voicemail explaining that she received everything, but they’re almost full for next year and she’s going to hold my daughter’s application for two weeks. She is doing this in case some “paying” (word she used) VPK families apply after my daughter. She said it made more sense to fill the entire day, rather than the 3 hours... I can’t help but feel like this is discrimination because we’re not paying extra for wrap around care. The state pays for the VPK.. this cant be legal- can it??"

The photograph was taken at a manager’s unlocked computer while their email was up. The same computer is also “publicly” used by other employees.

I admitted to having a photograph on my phone, however my coworker played no part in the situation whatsoever. I shared the information to another coworker of mine because he was getting unfairly paid, so that was the catalyst that led to him quitting.

The suspension was given by HR at the same time that the investigation was being described to us, so we had no time to prepare. They have since not been in contact with us regarding the current state of the investigation. We were part-time employees.

In essence, I was in possession of a photograph, while my coworker honestly did not play any part in that situation. Although, we were told that the company has evidence against my coworker. My questions include... Who was really at fault? Myself for being in possession of employee pay rates?

Lastly, could my coworker and I have a case against this, and would it be worth pursuing?

legaladvice,[WI] Possible illegal lease clauses? Void lease? How to proceed?,"Hello! I'm in Wisconsin. I was looking through my lease recently to see what it said about breaking my lease, as I am hoping to move to a new place earlier. However, I believe that the clauses regarding breaking the lease, subletting, and re-renting are illegal and therefore possibly void my lease. The clauses are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**14. SUBLETTING OR RE-RENTING YOUR APARTMENT**  
**a. Subletting:** Should resident(s) desire to sublet their apartment, the lessee must find a qualified replacement. All sublets must be approved by the management; this does not release the original lessee from the obligations, conditions, and terms of the lease. Resident(s) shall be subject to a $100.00 non-refundable sublet fee per applicant to cover administrative costs. In the event management sublets your apartment for you, the resident is subject to a $150.00 sublet fee. These fees do not include or cover any advertising costs and is NOT termination of payment. Lessee’s security deposit will not be refunded until the termination date of the original lessee(s)’s lease -- lessee should get a security deposit from the sublettor. Management does not do apartment inspections for sublets. Inspection reports will be provided.  
**b. Re-renting:** In the event the resident needs to re-rent their apartment, it is the resident’s responsibility to find a qualified replacement, $100.00 administrative fee applies. If the resident elects to have management assist in this re-rental, there will be a fee of ½ the security deposit plus costs for advertising, loss of rent and time spent per showing. These fees in no way release resident from the previous contractual agreement. Re-rental applies ONLY between March 1 and August 1, otherwise it is considered a sublease and the above listed provisions apply.  
&gt;  
&gt;17. If Tenant unjustifiably moves from the Premises before the last day of the rental term, Tenant shall be liable for all rent due under this Agreement through the last day of the term, plus damages incurred by the Landlord, less any net rent received by Landlord, in re-renting the Premises. If the Tenant is absent from the Premises for 3 consecutive weeks without written notice to Landlord, Landlord may deem, at their sole discretion, that the Tenant has abandoned the Premises, and proceed to re-rent the Premises.”

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that seemed a little ridiculous to charge the tenant for re-rental and all those extra fees, so I looked into it. I believe it violates the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
“**704.44  Residential rental agreement that contains certain provisions is void.** Notwithstanding s. 704.02, a residential rental agreement is void and unenforceable if it does any of the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;**(3m)** Provides for an acceleration of rent payments in the event of tenant default or breach of obligations under the rental agreement, or otherwise waives the landlord's obligation to mitigate damages as provided in s. 704.29.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“**704.29  Recovery of rent and damages by landlord; mitigation.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**(1)**  Scope of section. If a tenant unjustifiably removes from the premises prior to the effective date for termination of the tenant's tenancy and defaults in payment of rent, or if the tenant is removed for failure to pay rent or any other breach of a lease, the landlord can recover rent and damages except amounts which the landlord could mitigate in accordance with this section, unless the landlord has expressly agreed to accept a surrender of the premises and end the tenant's liability. Except as the context may indicate otherwise, this section applies to the liability of a tenant under a lease, a periodic tenant, or an assignee of either.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(2)**  Measure of recovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(a)** In this subsection, “reasonable efforts"" mean those steps that the landlord would have taken to rent the premises if they had been vacated in due course, provided that those steps are in accordance with local rental practice for similar properties.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(b)** In any claim against a tenant for rent and damages, or for either, the amount of recovery is reduced by the net rent obtainable by reasonable efforts to rerent the premises. In the absence of proof that greater net rent is obtainable by reasonable efforts to rerent the premises, the tenant is credited with rent actually received under a rerental agreement minus expenses incurred as a reasonable incident of acts under sub. (4), including a fair proportion of any cost of remodeling or other capital improvements. In any case the landlord can recover, in addition to rent and other elements of damage, all reasonable expenses of listing and advertising incurred in rerenting and attempting to rerent, except as taken into account in computing the net rent under the preceding sentence. If the landlord has used the premises as part of reasonable efforts to rerent, under sub. (4) (c), the tenant is credited with the reasonable value of the use of the premises, which is presumed to be equal to the rent recoverable from the defendant unless the landlord proves otherwise. If the landlord has other similar premises for rent and receives an offer from a prospective tenant not obtained by the defendant, it is reasonable for the landlord to rent the other premises for the landlord's own account in preference to those vacated by the defaulting tenant.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(3)**  Burden of proof. The landlord must allege and prove that the landlord has made efforts to comply with this section. The tenant has the burden of proving that the efforts of the landlord were not reasonable, that the landlord's refusal of any offer to rent the premises or a part thereof was not reasonable, that any terms and conditions upon which the landlord has in fact rerented were not reasonable, and that any temporary use by the landlord was not part of reasonable efforts to mitigate in accordance with sub. (4) (c); the tenant also has the burden of proving the amount that could have been obtained by reasonable efforts to mitigate by rerenting.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(4)**  Acts privileged in mitigation of rent or damages. The following acts by the landlord do not defeat the landlord's right to recover rent and damages and do not constitute an acceptance of surrender of the premises:  
&gt;  
&gt;**(a)** Entry, with or without notice, for the purpose of inspecting, preserving, repairing, remodeling and showing the premises;  
&gt;  
&gt;**(b)** Rerenting the premises or a part thereof, with or without notice, with rent applied against the damages caused by the original tenant and in reduction of rent accruing under the original lease;  
&gt;  
&gt;**(c)** Use of the premises by the landlord until such time as rerenting at a reasonable rent is practical, not to exceed one year, if the landlord gives prompt written notice to the tenant that the landlord is using the premises pursuant to this section and that the landlord will credit the tenant with the reasonable value of the use of the premises to the landlord for such a period;  
&gt;  
&gt;**(d)** Any other act which is reasonably subject to interpretation as being in mitigation of rent or damages and which does not unequivocally demonstrate an intent to release the defaulting tenant.”

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the giant wall of legal text! Basically, I feel like stating that the lessee must find a new tenant OR pay a fee to management for them to assist in re-renting is “waiv\[ing\] the landlord's obligation to mitigate damages as provided in s. 704.29.” If that’s the case, then my lease would be “void and unenforceable.” If this turns out to be true, what are my options? How do I proceed?

I would like to move to a new place before my lease is up in August. I do not have a place picked out or money saved up, but I plan to soon (hopefully to move out by March or April? TBD I guess). Once I have a new place to go, can I just say (in nicer and more professional terms, obviously) “Hey my lease is void because \[clause\] per \[law\] and is therefore unenforceable, so I’m leaving on \[date\] and not obligated to pay you anything”???

Would they be able to hold me liable for any lost rent or costs of re-renting if it’s void? Even if it’s NOT void, I read somewhere (don’t have it handy) that landlords can ONLY charge for admin fees, advertising costs, and any lost rent, NOT for any time spent showing or other costs associated with renting the apartment, as those are considered normal course of business. So a lot of the fees listed in the lease are illegal as far as I understand it.

Another concern I have is that I’ve lived here under the same lease since August 2018, so I’m worried that they can hold it against me? I didn’t know there were illegal clauses when I signed, and I think it’s reasonable to expect the landlord to know if what they’re doing is legal. Could they turn around and go “Sorry, you lived here for x amount of time and never said anything so you’re SOL!”

So I guess my main questions are:

Is my lease probably void?

What can I do if my lease is void?

What’s the best way to proceed with moving out early?

legaladvice,"Spouse DUI, as car owner now I'm a co-defendent. [MS]","Throw away account because some may recognize my situation.

MS is not a community property state, if that makes a difference.

My spouse (soon to be ex) is an alcoholic.  In 2018,  she was arrested for DUI.  She was in jail for 3 days and released with a court date. 

48 hours after release, at 9 in the morning, she left the house while I was working.  I had mentioned rent was due, and that I would go at lunch.  Spouse took it upon herself to go.  I did not know she was drunk, nor did I give her ""permission"" to take the car, but it can be presumed I should have known.  

She got into an accident, was arrested after blowing a .21, and was a suicide threat so taken to the hospital.  I found out when I called her phone and an officer picked up.

The car was in my name only, by my choice.  She was in rehab when I had to buy it.

My spouse was removed from the house 2 months later due to other alcohol related issues.

About 6 months ago, a process server appeared asking for my spouse.  I explained she no longer lived there, but provided a new address.

Today, I was served with an amended case, now naming me as a co-defendent due to me ""allowing"" access to the car.

Now, here is where it gets iffy.  I realize I'm most likely screwed.

She did not have my permission to drive intoxicated (a given). However, I could not stop her from driving.

In a previous interaction while she was under the influence, I attempted to take the keys from her so she could not drive.  In turn, she locked herself in the bathroom and called the police, stating domestic violence.

When the police arrived, I was informed I could not prevent her from taking the car.  I could report it as stolen. But physically stopping her could be seen as domestic violence (restricting access to transportation and any potential bruising from obtaining/keeping keys).

That was not the first time she had called the police while under the influence.  I was scared if I stopped her I would lose my kids over a dv charge.  She had already once successfully had the police assist in removing them previous in 2018.   Of note: I have never even been detained.  No charges ever filed.  No protective orders.  It was her way of controlling me.

legaladvice,"Police add evidence from crime B to get prosecuter to charge heavily on crime A, what is this called and where can I get more info. Thank you","I may repost this as I think people are having difficulty getting what I'm trying to ask but here goes!

There is property where police had set up surveillance to catch GRAFFITTI vandals that had vandalized an area multiple times ( writing deregetory statements, etc.).

Subject A entered that area and out of curiosity opened a hatch near that site to see what was in it, it was a drainage hole with a float (like the one on your toilet that stops water). The float is designed to alert utility if flooding. Lifting that hatch lifted the float, sending a notification.

Police check surveillance and only see subject a looking in hatch, go to speak with him, and he is honest of what he did, they say ok and leave. They also take down surveillance.

5 months later subject A is charged with felony malicious destruction of property.
Subject A for a fact has not caused a dime of damage, everything is working as should.

***** However, in report prosecutor uses to decide to press charges, the last two pages specifically include an invoice for cleaning up graffitti, as well as receipts for supplies purchased (paint) to clean up graffitti. This is in subject A's report and is in such a fashion, prosecution will see name of charge, pictures (taken out of context) showing subject A standing near vandalised area. And finally, invoice for graffitti clean up and supplies purchased.

Is there some law or rule stopping police from including evidence of a similar nature, but has nothing to do with what subject A did, in the police report? 
Where can I find more info?

P.s police took down surveillance to get subject A for crime. 3 days later , Subject A sees teenagers vandalising same spot that had been cleaned, took pictures of kids and graffitti and sent to detective.

legaladvice,[FL] Can legal action be taken against someone who filed a false police report?,"Someone called the cops saying my toddler is always crying and it's an ongoing problem. I was at work when the police arrived. My toddler was at home with a babysitter. Apparently he was laughing, eating M&amp;Ms when the cop arrived and saw there wasn't a problem. Not that there would because we live on 5 acres with no close neighbors, and my child does not cry anymore than a typical child. 

Anyway, we pulled the police report and lo and behold, it was a family member we kicked out last summer for ongoing issues. He is a truck driver and is hardly ever in the state. We have not seen him since last summer. My guess is he got a hair up his butt and decided to try and get ""revenge"" on us by doing this. 

Can we use this information to sue him in court for falsely filing against us? The cop wrote everything was fine with our son in the report and it seems things have been dropped, but I'm pretty pissed off that someone attempted to involve DCF over petty issues that did NOT involve my child. What if he keeps doing this? What options do we have to protect ourselves and our son from what we now consider vile scum?"
legaladvice,[Landlord/Tenant--Illinois] A water leak in an adjacent unit ruined/damaged several of our shoes. Is it worth an insurance claim? And what does our landlord owe us?,"We probably have around $500 worth of damage to our entire shoe collection (estimated because, as explained below, some of the damage is hard to value). Several of my own shoes were completely ruined, and that is easy to place a value on. However, my boyfriend collects shoes as a hobby and as a semi-side hustle. His shoe collection is in mint condition including the original boxes. His ability to resell his shoes at top dollar is partially dependent on its original box being in mint condition. In the water leak, 5 of his shoe boxes were completely ruined and the shoes inside now smell musty. While his shoes are still wearable, their resale value is compromised because of the box condition and the smell.

**EDIT:** The cause of the leak is directly traceable to an adjacent unit misusing their washing machine. We weren't given the details because we are simply the lowly tenants, but it seems pretty clear that the adjacent unit is at fault.

**Here are our questions:**

* Is the devaluation of his shoe collection something we can claim on our renter's insurance policy? 

* Our deductible is $500, so I am not even sure it is worth a claim. What other options are there if we don't claim this on insurance?

* What does our landlord owe us in this situation, if anything? If claiming this damage on our insurance policy doesn't make financial sense, can we be compensated by our landlord? (Note that we rent from a condo owner in a condo association, not an apartment complex)


We're both going though a tight spot financially right now, so while it may seem simple to merely replace these items, it really isn't feasible for us at this point in time. Plus it is difficult to replace shoe boxes that my boyfriend was able to receive on a limited release and are no longer in stock, only available at resale prices. 

Thank you in advance, any advice is appreciated! And I know the damage could have been much worse. It feels a little silly talking about shoes when other people's problems are much more severe, so we are counting our blessings."
legaladvice,"Flooded apartment, need legal advice","I am posting this on behalf of my friend in Boston, MA.


I am currently on a 9-month lease for an apartment in fenway. My apartment got flooded last Sunday, January 19th and I was told to vacate the apartment. The reason for the flooding was that an apartment 4 stories above me kept the heater off, and the radiator pipe burst. The property manager told me they would reimburse me for all the nights I would be vacated, by taking the monthly rent and dividing it by 30. At first, I was told that I would be back in my apartment within a couple days, then a week, and now indefinitely. They have to remove all the furniture and personal belongings to change the flooring and finishing. They’re offering to put me in a hotel with half as many amenities as my apartment and I would still have to pay rent with no reimbursement. 

I would like to know my legal options."
legaladvice,My aunt drove under the influence and caused a horrific accident where she and the other driver were both critically injured. Will she still go to jail even if she doesn’t fully recover?,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to ask this question, if anyone knows where else I should post instead, please let me know!

My aunt is a terrible person. She very rarely faces consequences for her actions and this time, she MAJORLY fucked up. She caused a head-on collision while driving drunk or high or both and critically injured herself and the other driver. 

She has many bad injuries but I think most importantly, she had a TBI and required surgery for it. She now has some amnesia, doesn’t remember the accident, can’t really take care of herself, etc...

She is supposed to be released into some rehab facility soon, and the family lawyer can’t (or won’t?) tell us what happens if she doesn’t fully recover. Is there anyone who can shed some light on what happens to people in a situation like this? Will she go to jail? 

The young man she hit will likely never fully recover. His family deserves justice.

legaladvice,"[NYC] Inherited gun, past 15 day surrender window, help","I live in NYC and inherited a couple of my father's pistols (357 and detective special) when he passed away. This happened over a year ago. I was planning to sell them but never got around to it. They have been sitting unloaded in a box with trigger locks, and there isn't any ammo with them period.

I just started doing research and see that in NYC when this happens you have 15 days to surrender to the police, while you figure all your paperwork out, and they'll hold it for 2 years. I am obviously way past 15 days, but I want to go surrender them now to eventually be able to sell them. But considering the length of time that has past, is there a realistic risk they will arrest me for doing this? 

He bought these guns in the 70's when he was a cop, and I literally have his original gun store receipt and his license (from NJ)...so not likely they will turn up in any database. Everything I read online says you have 15 days, and if get caught afterward you basically are screwed since NYC is unique and very strict. But if I want to surrender them now, so I need to get a lawyer involved or just call my local precinct?"
legaladvice,Served with legal notice from my grandfather to vacate the house within 15 days?,"My family and I have been living here since even before I was born as my father married my mother in 1990.

Today, we got served with a notice from his lawyer stating we agreed upon paying him(my grandfather) rent on ""verbal agreement"" in 2004 and since 2014, we haven't paid him any rent. All this is a lie and this was never agreed upon. Also the fact that it is our house but the lease of the house may be in my grandfather's name/might be an ancestral house. 

In the notice it says we should pay the pending amount since 2014 and vacate the premises peacefully within 15 days. Failing to vacate the premise, they will take a legal action against us.
Now, let me tell you they're not very nice people and have been arguing over it with us for some time now.

Now I have a couple of questions.

1. Can they forcefully evict us even though no such agreement was formed?
2. What would be the best thing to do in this situation?
3. Wouldn't they owe an explanation as to why they suddenly started demanding rent in 2004 when we started living here when my dad married mum? Also, my dad was born here so add 25 more years to that.

legaladvice,[US][OK] 7 minutes labor law clarification?,"Hello! First time posting so I hope I am doing this properly.

I recently got paid. I'm full time and work 40 hours. Because I'm aware of the 7 minute labor law, where employers don't have to pay you for up to 7 minutes past any quarter (:00, :15, :30, :45) I will often clock out a few minutes early (when reasonable) as early as 8 minutes past a quarter. I've read that they're obligated to round up if an employee works 8 minutes past a quarter. I assumed it was to the next quarter.

However, I noticed I was only paid for 78 hours instead of 80 this last pay cycle. I went and did the math for all my punches and it came out to this:

Actual punches = 78.3hr (So closer to the 78 hours)

Rounded up punches = 79.2hr (Taking into account punch ins past a quarter but within the 7 minutes, this would be the amount it would be should the punches at 8+mins past the quarter round up to the next quarter, so I'm still missing an hours pay)

My question is basically, is my workplace not following this law outside of their own interest (only rounding down, not up)? Or am I misinterpreting or misunderstanding something regarding this? I'm really big into knowing workers rights, so I would love some clarification about this! Thank you in advance.

Edit: For some reason it didn't register that I put my location in the title so to avoid any issues, I'm in the United States, specifically in Oklahoma state.

Edit 2: Guess I need to clarify that the issue I'm seeing is that they only ever round down. If I clock in at 9:05pm, the clock counts me in as ""on time"" at 9pm but I am not paid for those 5 minutes due to the 7 minute law. This I understand. Similar to how if I clocked out at 5:33am, I would only be paid up until 5:30am. However, if I clock out at 5:23, 8 minutes past the quarter, they do not round up like they're supposed to. They only ever seem to round down, which is why I am missing an entire hour of pay.

My workplace counts work time in 15 minute intervals, not by exact punch in.

Also here is an excerpt from where I read on this law and how I understood it:

***""When a company tracks work time in 15-minute increments, the cutoff  point for rounding down is 7 full minutes. If an employee works at least  7 full minutes, but less than 8 minutes, the company can round the  number down to the nearest 15 minutes. If the employee works at least 8  full minutes, the employer must round up. Note that this rule slightly  favors the employer; in a 15-minute period, up to 7 minutes and 59  seconds of work time can be rounded down.""***"
legaladvice,"Drunk in public court date... What to do?! (Los Angeles, CA)","Back in November, I was arrested in West Hollywood by the LA County Sheriff's Dept for public intoxication (647 f P).

I suspect something might have been slipped into my drink, but I was also drinking myself so I can't say for sure. After waking up pretty confused and distraught, I used the door to exit the house leading into the backyard. I was planning to just leave through the side gate and call a Lyft to get home. Of course, both side gates were locked from the inside so I couldn't get out! They were too high to climb over and the fences had spikes on them. I started knocking on the back door I had just exited from but nobody came down; the house was dark. I must have been making enough noise out there for someone to hear because they called the cops. They arrested me on the spot for PI and hauled me off to jail for the night. I thought I was just getting put in the drunk tank until I sobered up and then would just be released. As I was being discharged, though, they told me that I have a court date on January 27. Great.

legaladvice,Death/bankruptcy question,"Hello everyone. My question for the community - my mother in law passed away this past Monday morning. As my wife is understandably not up to making phone calls right now, I’ve been handling notifying her creditors that she passed. I should say - she didn’t have much. She was 70 and died after her leukemia which was in remission came back. She only made it about a week after the relapse. Anyway, she has a house with a mortgage. She has a car which she was still paying on. She had clothes and a bed; that’s about it. So not much in the way of estate to speak of. She filed bankruptcy last year largely due to medical debt and credit cards she had; her bankruptcy was discharged on 11/13/19. My question for you concerns her bankruptcy attorney - she filed on a payment arrangement with the attorney; she paid a fee monthly to pay off the balance of the filing. Most creditors, when I called to notify, were sympathetic, told me to send a death certificate, etc. Her attorney? “Oh, her outstanding balance with me is $1,280”. No sympathy, no anything (side note - I had looked to file and met with him and thought he was a gigantic asshole; so I didn’t use him). She didn’t have much in the way of life insurance; it’s gonna cover the cremation, that’s it. She has one child; my wife. What can her attorney do from here? Does my wife end up owing for that amount? If he hadn’t been a gigantic dick I would’ve been more receptive to it; but holy shit do I not want to pay this guy a dime. 

tl;dr - my mother in law died with no assets and has an outstanding debt to her bankruptcy attorney. Can he sue/try to collect/attach a lien to property from the deceased’s daughter? Location is Pinal County, Arizona."

Located in California.


Some friends and I have been renting this 5/3 with a pool since February of 2019, almost a year now. 
It’s complicated because we don’t have a copy of the lease for ourselves. 6 month lease and then month to month. 
We’ve asked a couple of times and he says he will bring it by next time but never does. 
Landlord and homeowner is an older fella, kind of cool, keep to himself kind of guy. 
This is the weirdest rental situation any of my friends and I have been in. It’s not through a rental agency. They own the property and home. At one point it was for sale. 
Like I said, we don’t have a copy of the lease we signed. It was almost like him and his wife printed out rental agreements online and had us sign. We love the house and everything for the most part has been great otherwise. Beautiful home and pool. 
Because of the pool, he lets himself out to the backyard where the pool is (gated) and tends to the pool and possibly other yardly things about once a month. 
He’s not the most consistent. Consistent enough to be once a month and almost the first Sunday of every month but it’s not so exact. 
Thankfully, as a younger woman, I have only been out back by the pool once when he’s let himself back there. I managed to slip myself in the sliding glass door before he saw me in my swim suit. I’ve never said anything and that’s me to blame.
Anyways, it’s been almost a year now of him stopping by once a month for pool work. Does he have to give us a 24 hour notice? I’m not sure how to bring it up to him or if he’s even aware if that’s a law? If it is. 
How do I bring this up? Do I send him a letter? Try to be here when he comes next to try to stop him and ask?"

I was making sandwiches at my fast food service job when a customer came behind the counter and physically attacked me, punching me in my head. Ultimately, I was terminated, my manager stating liability as the cause. 

----------

**full description of the scenario:**

It was early Wednesday morning (1/22/2020) around 5:20 AM. The only employees present were me and two co workers with no manager or supervisor. A customer came and ordered several sandwiches. I completed the order before he came to pick them up and he asked me which specific sandwich was which. As we are not required to label them I just told him, ""sorry man, you will just have to open them and see.""

The customer proceeded to call me names and harass me, making several racist comments as well (He was a white man and I am Latino). I did engage in a verbal argument with the man until he ultimately got physical and punched me in the head. I retaliated by pushing him in self defense then walked away. The man continued to linger around, verbally harassing me and threaten me, showing me an image of man and saying ""this man will be back for you""

Later in the day I was back at it making sandwiches when the man whom the other gentlemen showed me on the cell phone showed up and I noticed him filming me. I ignored him and then he proceeded to come behind the counter and physically attack me, punching me in the head. 

After the cops call were called and everything settled down, my manager turned around and tole me I was terminated. 

Do I have any legal recourse against my employer or either of the two men to physically attack me?

If you need any more thorough description of the scenario please let me know and any help or advice is greatly appreciated.

legaladvice,Pet foundation lost my cat and ignored it,"1/10/20 I registered my 2 feral cats, Caesar and Cleveland ( female cats) to be spay/neuter at the Lucy Pet Foundation Spay/Neuter van. I had both cats in carriers, the lady who was transporting cats into the van came and took cleveland inside. My brother and I warned her that she was a scared cat who can run at any moment. She took cleveland in, I was focusing and calming down caesar who was crying. The lady came to us saying cleveland ran off. She had 2 workers looking but they weren't doing a good job. So Blanca the Operations Director gave me her email to send her pictures of cleveland so she can make signs since she offered to do that. I send her the pictures but when we came back to pick up caesar from surgery, there was one sign and no pictures saying ""lost calico cat, contact this number and reward"" so I thought that was weird. And the fact that we have to keep reminding them about cleveland and they kept apologizing. Fast foward 2 weeks later, my uncle called the foundation to make a complaint but come to find out that the incident was never reported in which they should have and the workers broke multiple protocals and policies. The door was supposed to be shut when transporting cats into the van everytime. They had the door wide open when transporting cleveland from carrier to cage. Blanca was hired to make sure these incidents are prevented. They talked with her and she said she never received a message from me but that's wrong, we messaged back and forth. So i have proof. She kept changing the stories saying she been to the area where cleveland ran off to and been putting up signs...we been there everyday too and saw no signs only the ones we made.

Upon our request, they removed the light fixture from the ceiling (since water and electricity don't mix) and placed a tarp on the carpeted floor to protect it. However, this area of our apartment is not usable, for obvious reasons, and has affected us, as we are pretty cramped and worried about mold. The leasing office finally told us that the leak is due to problems on the roof and that it has to be replaced. No timeline for the repairs has been given.

We asked them about moving us to a new unit, but they claim that our lease is tied to the unit and that allowing us to move would mean signing a new lease with an increase in rent. They also said that they will not offer us moving costs. 

We wish to move because it's a significant square footage of our apartment that we can't use, we worry about the mold from the constant leak, the dehumidifier they gave us to place in that area uses electricity, our belongings are all stacked everywhere, but most importantly, they have not given us any timeline (although we know it's not a quick or easy fix).

I'd appreciate any guidance and suggestions on what information I should seek. We are trying to become more informed about the situation and our rights."
legaladvice,Car Accident Advice Needed,"Southern California, USA

I was t-boned by another car in Sept. and there weren't any witnesses and the other driver tried to flee the scene. We both ended up parking in a nearby plaza and his car was too damaged to operate any longer. I saw a figure (the driver) run away in the distance of the plaza while I was on the phone with the police. After I called the police, I called my insurance company. The police had the other car towed and wrote up a police report for me. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my car repaired since I was paying for the absolute min. to insure the car. I was given an estimate for the car and I was injured and am trying to get a settlement from the other driver's insurance. Thing is my attorney that I hired is saying the incident is being investigated and the other driver hasn't finished making a statement to his insurance. I got pictures of the other car before it was towed and you can see in the background of the pics that it is indeed in the plaza we both parked in. Pics sent to attorney already. A friend of mine said that parties involved in an accident have 60 days to make a statement after the accident is reported to the police and one of the parties insurance. It has already been (way over) 60 days and I should be recuperated from my injuries soon. Should I expect a settlement shortly after I feel better? My lawyer keeps saying that I have to wait until the other driver makes a statement to his insurance. I haven't told my lawyer about the 60 day thing from my friend because I got sick and just was told about it. BTW, my car is drivable, just an ugly eye sore on the passenger side. Any advice?"
legaladvice,Desired marriage last name not an option in Oregon,"I'm planning on getting married in Oregon this summer, but I'm running into a bit of a problem with the name change portion. This is my second marriage, and I never reverted back to my maiden name after I got divorced. My desired last name is MyMaidenName-SpousesName, and his desired last name is SpousesName-MyMaidenName. What would be the easiest way to achieve this? Are we going to need to do a name change separate from the marriage? Or are these options available in any neighboring states? I'm willing to do a courthouse wedding in Washington, Idaho, or California if it simplifies the process.

legaladvice,Is getting legally married be a beneficial option to consider these days?,"My boyfriend (33) and I (28) have been together for over ten years. We have completely interwoven lives and finances. Marriage was never really on our to do list, but lately I'm wondering if it might make things easier in the long run.

I handle finances, bills, doctors appointments, etc. for both of us, because he had a head injury some time ago and he gets overwhelmed by paperwork and people. It's a hassle at times, because some places can't talk to me unless he's given prior permission.

I also have concerns of what we would do if anything ever happened to him, because legally I think his family would be in charge of his care and I don't think they would have his best interests in mind.

Long story short, is getting married worth looking into? I just want to be able to take care of us without the hassle that I get as a non-spouse.

legaladvice,[FL] I live in an apartment and got charged a $2000 fine,"This past month, I had an issue at my apartment and needed to file a repair request at the office only to find out I’ve accumulated over $2000 fines for failure to pay my rent in full. 

I signed my year-lease in October 2018. When October 2019 came for renewal, I was not notified I needed to renew the lease in person. So, they automatically converted my previous 12-month lease to a month-to-month lease (without my knowledge) which is a much higher rate (about $2-300 extra). So, I continued to pay my usual rate (I go to the office to hand them a physical check every month) until they told me last week that I’ve incurred multiple penalty fees for not having paid the difference that totaled up to about $2000 over the course of October 2019 - January 2020.

Does this raise any red flags or any foul play? I want to know if there is a way to get out of or contest these fees. Should I talk to a lawyer? I would appreciate any help... I’m a busy musician living paycheck-to-paycheck and haven’t had the time to pay close attention to what’s been going on (which I admit is an oversight on my part).

legaladvice,Am I Screwed?,"So, I'll try to get to the exact point. I stupidly lent a stranger $600, I got his signature on a contract that he would pay me back $800 (interest)  within a certain time. I got a picture of his driver's license, found him on Facebook, and have his home address as well (well two addresses one from the license the other from a message saying the one from the license wasn't the same). Before everyone berates me on how stupid I am for trusting this guy, trust me I know. I was trying to sell some pricy things for my mother to get her some money for repairs around the house. Surprise, he didn't pay me the lone back. I filled in small claims, took my evidence with me and won by default since he didn't appear in court. Later, after the 30 days, he was given to pay me back were up, I went back to file a motion for proceeding. I gave the court the same address he was served at before, thinking I wouldn't need to call the court and make sure he was served since it worked last time. I got to the next court date and the judge told me he wasn't served, so he dismissed me. I still have the ruling in my favor, but I dont really know what to do at this point. If anyone has some useful advice on how I can proceed from here that would be greatly appreciated. Also, I was told I could garnish wages, or garnish it from his bank account. Unfortunately, I didn't get either of those pieces of information written down anywhere. I recall he told me he worked as some sort of construction worker if I recall correctly. I'm also located in Indiana if state law matters for this. Again thanks to any who can help.

Edit: so I called the court just to make sure I didn't overlook any information I was supposed to get, and apparently the court never sent the serving papers to the sheriff in order to serve the defendant. So, I don't know if the court is at fault in any way, but that's super annoying my next court date is in April apparently. I guess I'll make sure they actually mail the summons next time."

legaladvice,Freelance photographer here: Client past due on last 5 invoices,"I'm a freelance photographer in California.  Last year I was working with a clothing store shooting their clothes for their website, fairly regularly.  They use a 3rd party payment processor and that's who I send invoices to.  Middle of the year during a gap in work there was some issues with getting a few invoices paid, the client claims they didn't know the payment processor was behind on payments and blamed me for re-sending all my invoices at once to get paid.  They needed more work in the fall and so I was semi able to leverage this into making sure they were getting caught up on invoices.

By December they were behind on 6 invoices so I began reaching out to the payment processor weekly and kept getting responses like ""We're looking into this,"" ""we're working on getting these paid,"" etc.  Beginning of January the client wants to shoot again and I make it clear I need an answer on these pending invoices before I'm willing to shoot again.  They blamed both the payment processor for the delay in payments as well as me for supposedly not following up (I've kept a detailed log of all invoice submissions as well as followups that show this to not be close to true).  They also threatened to find another photographer if it was an issue.

So now they're working with another photographer and I've clearly lost the client.  I got one invoice paid this week which dated back to June, but still 5 remaining from sept-nov.  I've emailed twice this week to both the client and payment processor asking for an estimated timeline on payment and have received no response.

For what it's worth, this client is the type that blames everyone else for every problem his business has and clearly has never admitted fault in anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I play to do next and I would appreciate any advice if I'm missing any steps or if there is anything else I should be doing.

Monday I will email them with the ultimatum that if they don't respond to my email by the end of the week to let me know their intention to pay me, I'll be filing in small claims court. (Any helpful advice on filing small claims in LA would be great too).

As the photographer, I own the copyrights to every single photo I shot for them (though I have not federally registered them).  We do not have any agreement stating otherwise that would transfer to them any copyrights.  In fact, there are no agreements in play that even grant them usage rights for the photos.  Should I also mention that as the copyright holder,  I will be filing DMCA takedown notices for all images related to those unpaid shoots until payment is rendered?

I have also considered contacting the new photographer they've hired just to give him a heads up that they haven't paid their previous photographer and that's why he got the gig working with them.  Would that be a bad idea?

legaladvice,"Problem with electricity bill (London, UK)","On Monday, I received our quarterly electricity bill, which I pay online. To my horror, it was approx £500, compared to approx £95 this time last year and approx £85 this time in 2018.

A man came to read the meter around 14 days ago so I checked that his reading was correct (it was) and then told my SO. We both thought our supplier had made a mistake so I called them, SO was right with me at the time.

After spending some time talking to someone who obviously couldn't deviate from her script, I reluctantly had to go full-on Karen and demand to speak to her manager.

Manager explained that our four quarterly bills last year were all estimated due to a meter reader not having been able to gain access to the house. Therefore current high bill is due to us needing to pay the arrears.

Sounds fine. Except that they usually send an email saying the bill is due and would I like to submit a reading, which I do. I told them this and they admitted that they had received my readings but hadn't used them. They couldn't or wouldn't explain why. Also, their estimates seemed pretty much in line with our usage prior to October 2018, the last time a man actually read the meter.

I asked if our meter could possibly be faulty as we've lived in the house for 25 years. At this point I am still damn sure we haven't used all this electricity. Then manager drops a bombshell. Apparently, meter reader found a magnet attached to the meter. Obviously I hadn't put it there. I was put in the embarrassing position of having to ask SO, while still on the phone, if he had put it there. He vehemently denied it, didn't look guilty or anything. I asked manager why meter reader hasn't mentioned it to me at the time. No response from manager.

I told manager that we were disputing the bill and needed justification in writing so we could seek advice.

Since then, law-abiding idiot that I am, I've barely slept with the worry and have had constant headaches. I could end up in court, maybe lose all my savings, maybe even prison? Am not sure whether I can cope with the worry of fighting this. Should I just shut up and pay up? Obviously, we can pay it but I don't want to hand over money without them proving that we do actually owe it.

Then there is this strange thing. The electricity meter is just inside the front door, outside the downstairs toilet. As I answered the door, I noticed a deposit in the cat litter tray in the downstairs toilet. While the man read the electricity meter, I scooped the poop, apologising to him, so I didn't actually watch him read the meter. Then I stepped out of the toilet and allowed him to step in, to read the gas meter. He was in there quite a while and he was fiddling with something but I couldn't see what he was doing from outside. I mentioned this to my SO after he'd gone. SO was mildly surprised. We have no problem with our latest gas bill. 

I sent the following email to our energy provider and have had no response: 

""I understand that the four quarterly meter readings during 2019 were estimates by [provider] and any actual meter readings that I submitted were ignored.

I am quite surprised that the last time our meter was read was October 2018 as we are at home most of the time and sometimes we find a card has been put through the door asking us to call to make an appointment, which we do.  We certainly have no objection to our meter being read at any time convenient to us.

I have looked at the bills as far back as possible on your website and I see that our usage in Q2/2018 was 272 units and in Q3, 226 units. As far back as I can remember (we moved to this address in September 1994), this seems reasonably accurate. 

When you write, could you please elaborate on your suggestion that a magnet was found attached to the meter.  Do you have any photographic proof of this?  As I was with the man who read the meter, can you please suggest a good reason why he didn't mention it to me?  Also, are you suggesting that he removed an item (the existence of which I dispute) from our house without consent? 

I shall pay the gas bill this afternoon as we are not disputing this.

I look forward to hearing from you by post shortly."""

I just had a baby, and I want to start taking my paternity leave.  I will be taking it discontinuously (working 3 days a week, taking 2 days of leave per week, for as many weeks as equates to 12 full time weeks).  My employer is fine with the discontinuous part of it. The first 6 weeks worth are paid through california, and then I can do another 6 weeks worth unpaid, my job will be protected through all 12 weeks.

My employee handbook says this: ""Employees on leaves of this nature are required to use all available Sick time,
Vacation time and/or Floating Holidays; remaining leave time will be unpaid.""  My employer is a national company, over 5,000 employees in 47 states, HQ in texas.

But I read somewhere that if I am recieving a pay benefit through the state, my employer cannot force me to run my PTOs concurrently with paid leave.  Is this the case?

legaladvice,Looking to buy vacant lot next door,"I'm looking to buy the vacant lot next door to my home. There was previously a home there that was condemned (due to a fire) and demolished by the city. There was a 20k tax lein placed on the property and the city went after the owner in court. The owner paid the lein off in full in a settlement out of court about 2 months ago. I have spoken with the city and they state that the only thing owed against the property now is $35 in taxes for this year.

I have heard a lot of stories about the fire - insurance fraud so insurance didn't pay out, mortgage still in place and being paid. Not sure about any of this.

I have reached out to the daughter of the owner and she states that she is willing to sell due to lack of interest, but has NO idea where to start because she has no paperwork for the property.

I have offered $1500 cash for the property, which some would find to be outrageous, but it's well worth that to my family and I. I'm not looking for an investment property - I'd just like to widen my driveway a bit and have more room for my daughter to play.

legaladvice,Property Management Co negligence,"I own a duplex, and hired a major property management company to take care of the property, as I live a couple hours away. They have been extremely slow, and frequently drop the ball. They, for example, forgot to take a pet deposit after we explicitly (in writing), requested one. They also never handled the switching of the utilities, so I got calls about delinquency on those bills. 

I only mention those things because I want to express that this is a pattern of behavior, not an isolated mistake. The thing that I need to ask about today, is the liability they have for a burst pipe in an unoccupied unit. It has been months since the unit was occupied, because they have taken so long to do the few repairs that needed to be done around the house. We warned them, again in writing, that they needed to keep the heat turned up in the unit, because we had trouble with one of the pipes in the past freezing up in the cold.

I got an email yesterday that the pipe burst, the brand new flooring (installed two weeks ago) appears to be ruined, and there was a lot of water in the unit. It has not been terribly cold here, it was at least 20-30 degrees colder last winter, and we had no problems. 

So my question is, does the property management company hold any liability here? It's going to cost me well over $1,000 to fix everything, I am guessing based on their description, and it seems like since I warned them about that pipe freezing in the past that they should hold some liability, if they did not keep the heat turned up high enough, or open the cupboard doors to allow airflow?

Last week, I happened to check CreditKarma for something unrelated and see the Healthcare provider reported me as delinquent, and my credit score had dropped almost 50 points.  I called the healthcare provider and asked what was going on.  They said they had run my card last year for only $50 instead of the full amount of $53.41.  They then stated they don't send bills outs with less than $5 on the balance, so I never received any notice.  They just sent me to collections.

The Healthcare Provider called today and said you have to pay us the $3, or else they won't fix their mistake.  Also, they stated it takes up to a month for them to send a letter to the credit agencies to get my score corrected and it could take even longer than that for the agencies to actually fix it, so it shows up right.

I went to their company [website](https://www.yourbenportal.com/n/eob-concierge-service) and I'm getting all sorts of alarm bells just looking at the home page. How does their business work in such a consumer friendly state like California?

legaladvice,Help getting Social Security Card Replacement,"Hi all!Throwaway account per my girlfriends request.

Not sure if this is the best place to post this but my girlfriend (18F) and I (21M) live in Oklahoma with my parents, and we've been trying to get her important documents and it's been a....headache. See normally you would just get those from your parents. Well...her mom swears she has know idea where they are, and her dad hasn't been in her life since she was little...he isn't even listed on her birth certificate. She hasn't held a job for the past year, and she's getting evicted and has until the end of the month to leave her house....all this to say we probably won't be getting her documents from her parents. We have her birth certificate because we were able to order a copy from the department of vital records office here in Oklahoma, and she knows her social security number because her mom had the good sense to at least write it down. The problem we're having with her Social Security Card is that from what we can tell she needs to bring something else along with her birth certificate, like a State issued ID...that we can't get...without her social security card... or an employee identification card (never held a job) a school identification card (she dropped out, and her school didn't have badges) a health insurance card (to her knowledge she has never had health insurance) or a us military identification card (she's not in the military). Is there any way to go about getting her card, or are we pretty much facing a brick wall? Any help at all would be much much appreciated."

My employer reprimanded me, cut my hours, and today fired me for not agreeing to come in on a specific day of the week I’ve never been able to work. TX","I was hired at a local restaurant a few months ago. On he day I was hired  informed my employer that I had another job, and would never be able to work on Sunday.

About two weeks ago I was offered a promotion to manager at a significantly lower rate than the other members of the management staff. I refused, saying that I was aware that all other members of manager were payed significantly more. My superior responded by yelling at me, and stating that I’m not allowed to talk about my pay rate. He also said “I’ll have to talk to (name of employees whose salaries I had cited) about this, because they shouldn’t be talking about this either.


The following two weeks I was scheduled for 1/2 the amount of hours that I had been consistently scheduled for since I had started working there.

Today, my boss asked me “so you’re going to be able to work on the Super Bowl right?”, and I told him “no, I told you the day that I was hired that o will never be able to work on Sunday, because I have another job and I have always been scheduled on Sunday’s”

Less than an hour later, I was called outside and told I will be fired unless I call my other job (right then, no less) and tell I can’t work on that day.

I feel like this whole situation is my supervisor retaliating against me because I spoke with other employees about my pay rate. 

I do understand that I’m in an at will employment state, but this feels like I was fired explicitly because my employer didn’t like that I talked about salary, and the Super Bowl was a convenient excuse.

legaladvice,[California] How do I go about my employer illegally paying below minimum wage?,"Hello,

I work for a hospital in a major city. I am currently a ""Per diem"" employee and make $15/hr + $2 for differential on night shift.

In my city, employers with over 26 employees must pay $14.25/hr. I have not accepted the position yet, nor have I voiced my concerns to my boss.

How would I go about dealing with this? Should I speak to my boss first? Should I talk to HR when I go to sign my new papers? Should I speak to a lawyer first?

legaladvice,"My small company laid me off - did not provide any paperwork or anything except my last check. My belongings are still at the office and HR has been dodging me to pick them up. She is now saying she will mail them to me. Orange County, CA","Okay, so I was working for a small company, less than 100 employees for a little over 2 years and on 1/10 HR came in and told me that it was my last day and gave me a check. The layoff was because they were really slow and they had to reduce workforce. I asked if there was any paperwork outlining the reason I'm being laid off and any paperwork and she said it would me mailed to me (she is honestly the worst HR that anyone in my department had ever dealt with. She constantly failed to take care of any of our paperwork like insurance, direct deposit. So i was doubtful shed mail it to me). After that she told me since it was the end of the day, we could make a separate appointment for me to come pick up my personal belongings. Well for 2 weeks I tried meeting with her and she constantly ignored my requests, or told me shed email me about a time to meet and I never heard anything. Finally I CCd my old manager on it and said I was going to be in the area around noon and she agreed. Unfortunately the appointment I had prior to meeting her ran long, I tried calling her with no answer. And she called saying not to bother showing up and she was just mailing my belongings. I asked about the paperwork and she said she mailed it and I asked if she could mail it again and email me a copy and she said yes.

So, my question is. Are employers required to provide paperwork at the time of layoff, or anything that I can leverage at this point? She has been a real pain this entire process. I have several fragile and sentimental decorations at desk, along with personal paperwork and I dont trust her to rummage through my belongings and to make sure they are packaged properly to arrive safely. I found out that she already began going through my desk and she found a notebook I was keeping of all the instances that she royally screwed up information. I was covering myself and printed out email, kept time cards, and wrote and dated all the instances. So she started going through it and read through my book. I just need to know if theres anything I can do or if I just have to wait for my stuff to show up and it's not broken.
 And hope that she actually provides me with the paperwork she says she is going to.

legaladvice,Is this legal?,"Very long story, I’ll try to sum it up. 

I’m 21, father to a year and a half old son and have a minimum wage job. 

Me and the mother recently broke up after 4 years. 

Almost two year ago we were in a wreck (not at fault). My car was totaled and my girlfriend was a week past her due date and suffered injuries. 

We finally settled this past November. 

Me and her both grow up dirt poor and both of our licenses were revoked. Mine die to so many unpaid citations, and hers do to a dui. We only got 8 grand but it was more money then we’ve ever had. And like I said we struggle financially so we wanted to make the best decision. We didn’t know when we were going to be able to get such a large sum of money at one time so we paid her tickets and get her license back. After everything that alone was about 2 grand. To get my license back it would be about 3 grand. So we bought two cars because the one we did have had just broke down. So at the end we both had new, reliable vehicles for the first time in our lives, and her license was back. We kept my car parked until I could get my license straight. 

Well me and her just had a terrible break up and I had to leave immediately. So I drive my car for the first time completely illegal. I just went 10 miles up the highway. Then I get pulled over. 

Instead of arresting me they schedule me a court date for city court. It was driving on revoked.

So today was the day. I went and the tickets added up to $2400 just from driving on revoked and not having insurance, etc. 

The chief and judge told me i had to come up with money or they were going to take me to jail and hold me there until the next court date. February 6th. I told them I struggle as it is and there no way I could come up with that. Basically saying just take me to jai life the 30 days that comes with a driving on revoked charge. But they weren’t taking that. They insisted I get money. Saying things like “these are very serious charges ya know” and asking me how much I get paid asking me how much my taxes will be. Asking if I had parents with a credit card, literally trying everything to get me to pull money out of my ass. So I call my sibling and mage to get $500 for the fines. Or so I thought. So I pay and the clerk tells me it may or may not go to the fines that this was all about. And the the judge talked to me on the phone asking how much I can have next week and keep him updated. 

Is this legal or was I just extorted?"

legaladvice,What legal grounds does this woman have to take action against me?,"Sorry this is long winded! 

 I’m a 20 year old college student living off campus with two friends. After our first lease ended, we were looking to find a place for our second semester (starting this January) and beyond. In November, we found a great house near campus with good lease terms and got in contact with the real estate agent. She was friendly and told us we “got the house as soon as our application went through.” So we put in the application and since were all going home for our winter break between semesters, we asked if we could keep our bigger belongings (bed frame, mattress, etc) in this new house’s garage over the break, to which the agent said yes. 

Flash forward to January 15, the day our semester starts, the agent has been ignoring us/not getting back to us on our application status for weeks, and then we get an email saying our application was denied and the renters found different people. This caught us completely off guard and for the last week+ we’ve been scrambling to find a place. The agent called one of us for the first time in a while two days ago but not to talk about the house. Instead she gets mad at us for not taking our stuff (bed frames etc) out of the garage and threatens to take legal action by the end of the week (in 2 days from now) if its not out. The kicker is that the bed frame and shelf actually broke during the break so we’d have to throw them out somehow.

At the moment we just found a shitty place where we can get by for the semester, but between juggling searching for this house and school starting, we have no time/money for uhaul to move our belongings out by Sunday. We tried reasoning with her but she’s very adamant and rude. Does she have any legal backing on what she can do to us if we don’t take our stuff out of that place by Sunday? 

Would really appreciate any help/advice!

legaladvice,"Gave a business a negative review, now their owner is harassing me","Location: US - AZ

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so the full story,

On Christmas eve (it was early in the morning) I called a massage place, their hours said open on google and so did their website so I figured they were open. Sure enough someone answered but all they said was ""Thank you for calling \*Business name\*"". I though it was a voicemail at first but decided to say ""Hello? are you open?"" apparently it wasn't a voicemail and someone gave an annoyed sigh and hung up.

I called back and this time somebody said ""Seriously do you know what day it is?"" very rudely. So I asked for a manager. She then yelled that she was the manager and hung up again.

I mean they put their hours online and answered like they were open so I thought they were open.

After that I decided to put a negative review on google because I thought it was messed up. Turns out the crazy owner didn't like that it ruined her perfect 5 stars and went on a rampage. About a month after I posted a review she responded to it saying she found my employer on LinkedIn and reported me and that ""hopefully that would take care of it"".

Next thing I know my employer is threatening to fire me if I don't remove the review. I can't afford to lose my job so I did remove it.

I tried reporting the business to google for harassing me but they said that they can't help and that I should try to explain the issue to my boss and see if he'd understand.

Is there anything I can do here against this lady for harassing me?

My dad is 64. Has Parkinson’s, dementia and hydrocephalus. 6’2”. This is relevant. He is unable to speak, basically at all. 

He was admitted to our local hospital on January 5th, for what we later discovered was pneumonia. He was under home hospice care. He looked like he was close to death. Lucky, they placed a g-tube, got him stable and things looked better.

He was discharged on 1/12 to a nursing home and was actually looking better. Discharged from the hospital at 139lbs.

Things were alright, at first. Now, the following have happened:

-Admission weight on 1/12 was 139, discharge weight on 1/24 was 123
-dark red urine
-bed sores 3 layers deep
-bleeding analy
-neglecting to give required medications
-using dirty medical equipment picked up off the floor
-dirty G-tube wasn’t cleaned, bandages had dirt rolling off him
-Consistently feverish and soaked in sweat, no one came to change after multiple attempts

This led to us demanding his transfer back to the hospital. The hospital supervisor basically said sorry but nothing else she can do.

I’ve started a complaint with the heath department and I’ve started intake with a lawyer. I’m waiting on his diagnoses.

Is there anything else that I can or should be doing to protect him? I’ve never seen such neglect.

legaladvice,Advice on Paying for Security Fix on Brand New Vehicle,"Background:

I bought a brand new vehicle around 6 months ago, I purchased the extended warranty alongside it and am fully covered for manufacturer issues with the vehicle outside of ""general wear and tear.""

The vehicle has less than 2000 miles on it and is in perfect condition still, not been in any wrecks etc.

Located in Texas, USA.

Issue:

On New Year’s Eve, the vehicle would not open or start with either of the electronic keys provided with the car. After getting it towed to the service department for the dealership where it was purchased they diagnosed it as an ""electrical issue"" replaced two parts and I got the car back on Jan 21st. On the 23rd I went to use the car and it was gone, it had been stolen.

I used the car's GPS locator to track the vehicle and with help from the police, retrieved it still in perfect condition, but again neither of my keys will unlock the car or start it. The officer dusted the car for fingerprints, then explained that another vehicle of the same make had been found in this exact same spot about a month earlier in the same condition and that the person stealing them was using a device to change the key frequency and just drive off with them.

After having the vehicle towed again to the dealerships service department and informing them of the underlying issue, they have now told me it will cost $400 to fix the security issue as it is not covered by the warranty and is being made as a customer request.

Personally I feel this is an underlying security issue that should never have existed in the first place and if my car is at risk others are too.

Any advice on whether or not my concerns/claims are warranted or not would be greatly appreciated, thank you for your time.

Would I be legally obligated to pay 100% of the gas and electricity bills simply because they're never here? My view is that because gas and electricity would be used if they were here regardless, I shouldn't have to pay 100%. They're utilities that are meant to be shared between all three tenants, and they're still contractually a tenant of the property. For instance, I have no problem paying 100% of the water bill because it's entirely based on how much water I use that month. But gas for example, I can't heat solely my room, it heats the whole house. Thanks for any advice:)

legaladvice,My boyfriend is not getting paid for holidays that he was told would be paid,"My boyfriend and I met working for a company in Maryland. We both had totally different jobs, but were both employed on a full time hourly basis with regular schedules each week. When I worked there, I was given the typical few holidays paid - Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Years Day, etc. as well as a few sick days and PTO. 

I quit a few months ago but he is still working there. Over the holidays, he was told that he would have Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day off and would be paid. However, he was also told that he needed to work the day before and after to get the paid day off, and he couldn’t have any “long weekends” i.e. the holidays wouldn’t be paid if they were the day before or after the weekend, which for his schedule is Sunday and Monday. 

When he finally got his check, he was never paid for these holidays. After chasing it up with his manager, HR and the general manager, he was told that hourly employees don’t get paid holidays and he won’t be paid. 

This sounds completely wrong to me, since I was given paid holidays as an hourly employee, plus he was specifically told by his manager that he would get paid for these days off and changed his entire schedule around.

The police have told me they definitively have enough evidence to charge the couple with 2 misdemeanors of unauthorized use of a credit card  - possibly more, they are waiting on surveillance from one of the stores and some records from the bank to see if they have enough to get them for a few of the transactions. 

Assuming at least the 2 charges go through, is there any further recourse I can pursue beyond whatever little fine the court gives them? I disputed the charges and the bank said they would refund the money, so I'm good there, but they took my $50 wallet and got my ID, which I had literally paid $40 to renew days before, so I'm having to spend another $25 or so to replace that.

legaladvice,Should I Sue? Do I have a case?,"Should I sue? Do you think that I have a case?

I had twins on December 1st, 2018. In February of 2019, I had a Gallstone attack. If you have never experienced one it is horrible pain. It feels like an elephant is standing on both your chest and back at the same time. It hurts to breathe, to move, to stand, sit or lay down. An attack (in my experience) can last 30 minutes to an hour and a half. This attack was so bad that I called my husband sobbing because I couldn't pick up the twins. When he got home I went to urgent care, still in the middle of an attack. At urgent care, I learned that it was a gallstone attack and was transferred to the hospital, where I would need to have surgery the next day to get the stone removed. The next day I had an ERCP, this is to find and dislodge the stone. They were unable to find the stone but they did poke my pancreas in the process. This caused my pancreas to ""explode"" into pancreatitis.

That night in the hospital my husband tells me in the worst pain that he has ever seen me in, I was unable to get comfortable. I really don't remember much of the next week. The nurses didn't believe the level of pain that I was in and they sent me down for a CT. What they saw was and is to this day the worst case of pancreatitis that the hospital had ever seen. They said that it looked like a bomb went off in my stomach. I woke up in the ICU and stayed there for 4 days.

The plan originally was to monitor my gallbladder to see if there were going to be any other problems and if so to have my gallbladder removed. However, because they poked my pancreas and I now had pancreatitis they couldn't remove my gallbladder until the pancreas calmed down.

For the next 6 months, I was in and out of the hospital because of Gallstone attacks and other complications. I was put on Dilaudid, a pain medication higher then Morphine. I got a pseudocyst in my stomach because of the extra fluid from the pancreatitis. They had to go in and put in a drain for the cyst. That drain got clogged and they had to go back in and unclog the first drain and add a second. I had 5 gallstone attacks after the first one that started all of this. With each one, I would get admitted to the hospital and they would put me on pain meds and starve me out for 8-9 days(that is all that they can do to get the pancreas to calm down).  We had to hire a nanny because I was so sick that I could care for my own children, I feel like I missed out on 6 months of their lives.

They told me that they couldn't take out my gallbladder until my pancreas went down. I told them that I was going to go to a different hospital where they would actually help me with my pain and take out my gallbladder. Magically the next day they said that they would take out my gallbladder. Because they caused me pancreatitis it wasn't the easy surgery that you hear about where they go through your belly button. They had to cut me wide open, 22 staples down my stomach. Oh and I woke up with a giant tube in my nose, something I was not informed of before surgery.

It is now January 2020 and I am still dealing with this. I may have Chronic Pancreatitis and have to go see an endocrinologist and an allergy specialist. I have a hernia from the surgery.

I understand that there are risks with every surgery and they make you sign your life away before you have one. I am just wondering if people think that I have a case. Does this fall under medical malpractice? I had nurses at the hospital where I was getting treated tell my family and myself that we should sue. That what happened to me is ridiculous. This week I had to go see the doctor that started this all and she told me that I have PTSD from everything. When I go to a new doctor and have to tell them my story they are always blown away by everything. What do you think? I think I have a case, but I have never sued anyone and I don't want to waste time and money on something that doesn't have a chance.

legaladvice,Breaking a Lease -insane landlord,"Hi there, 

My mother has lived in a duplex for 4 years. She is on a two year lease, which is up sept 1, 2020. Located in B.C. Canada 

Unfortunately she needs to break her lease, she has found an affordable housing apartment to live in for March 1st. The tendency papers for that unit are already signed and deposits given.
My mom suffered a fall down the stairs in duplex last year (no railing where there should have been one). She broke her back. She has become worse over this year and has just come home from the hospital. To get the the only bathroom in the duplex she has to go down to flights of stairs, this is no longer safe for her to do, another reason why she must leave. 
The lady at the affordable housing apartment called my moms landlord Lloyd. Llyod is an older man who is not a good landlord, greedy and snoopy. He told the lady in the phone when she called for a reference about rent being paid on time(rent always in time) that she should NOT let my mom live there because her house is dirty(untrue) he said she is not allowed to leave until May because that’s what works for him. He told her he was going to keep the security deposit and all months rent up to sept 1, 2020. 
The lady from the apartment was upset and could not believe what he said as he dodged all her questions as well. He tried to ruin it for my mom who we have been desperately trying to get into an affordable unit with no stairs. 
I do understand the laws of him going after her to recoup her his lost rent ONLY if he has tried and can proof he can’t find renters. I’m not sure if he can keep the damage and pet deposit if there is no damage and the place is left clean? 
We are meeting with him tomorrow Jan 25 to give written notice and try and work things out with him. 
Is there anything I should know before I talk to him? He’s unreasonable and sneaky. What should the written notice look like? This is giving him over a months notice. Should I ask him to sign a mutual form to end tenancy? We will be stopping post dated checks as well. 
Any advice would be great! I know breaking a lease isn’t right, but under the circumstances with my Senior mom we have to. I want to be prepared when I meet with him tomorrow."
legaladvice,Roommate Dispute,"
My roommates are upset at me. Last night we agreed to each be responsible for cleaning our own dishes. This morning they’ve locked all of their dishes, along with some of mine, in our kitchen cabinets. I called our property manager to see if this is allowed, and they said it’s not, but that they won’t get involved in roommate disputes. The property manager called them to tell them this but they still refuse to remove the locks. We are all on the lease together so they have no more of a claim to anything in our kitchen than I do. Since our property manager won’t get involved what should I do? They used rope locks with the combination &amp; I want to just cut them off, but I don’t want to get in any trouble. 

Edit: I live in Florida."
legaladvice,Privacy with respect to emailing personal details to medical companies,"Getting the question up front:

Are there any privacy laws, regulations, rules or anything I can bring to bear on on my medical provider to coerce them into handling my personal (not medical) information via a secure channel instead of over plain-text email? Is there a reasonable mechanism (like an Ombudsman, Virginia's SCC) for complaining about this provider and their cavalier approach to handling personal information? Am I just ""old man yells at cloud"" or is there a way to coerce change from my indifferent healthcare franchiser? I don't mean to ""sue"" them because I can't think of any grounds for some kind of suit and that's not really the point. But what formal/official channels can I use to exert pressure?

**Context**

I've lived in the UK for the last 10 years. Now I'm back in America (Fairfax County, Virginia) and slowly learning how few privacy protections we have. My doctor's office appears to either be owned by or affiliated with a large, regional healthcare franchiser that operates or supports lots of family practices all over the region (VA, DC, MD).

They want me to send them a form with all my personal details (name, address, sex, DoB, email, phone number) and they want me to send it to them by email. This suggests that not only do they want me to do that, but they've had other patients to do this in the past and will ask more patients do so in the future. We all know email isn't particularly secure. In virtually any situation where data security is regulated, regulations prohibiting sending sensitive informaiton by email (medical, credit card data, banking, etc.) But my doctor obviously asks patients to send personal information by email and then they're processing it that way. To be clear, there's absolutely no medical info requested on this form. Just the personal info I listed and my signature. There's probably some Outlook inbox at that company somewhere with hundreds or thousands of patients' plain text contact details in it.

**The back story:**

The doctor's office participates in a health information exchange. All patients are opted in by default (sigh). If you actually read the privacy policy enough, you find that you can opt out of sharing your healthcare information. That's when they sent me a legal opt-out form that requires all my personal information. I expected that and it makes sense. They ask me to fill it out, sign it, and email it back. So ironically those who are most interested in privacy—those who are opting out—are asked to just send all their details in an email and hope for the best. My first email to their privacy address got lost in their spam folder. Sigh. High-speed, automatic opt-in. Human, errorprone, manual system to opt out. And of course it's not retroactive. You can't unshare something. You can't opt-out before you exist in their system. Only after they've added you and shared a bunch of your info can you tell them to quit doing that.

**What I've done so far**

I've gone back and forth a bit with the folks who handle the forms. They're indifferent. They basically offered to send me a pre-stamped envelope so I wouldn't have to pay postage. While that could solve my immediate need, that's not the point. The year is 2020, not 1920. Secure online mechanisms are readily available, cheap, and reliable—it's just that email isn't it. My tax preparers have secure document uploads; my banks have secure uploads; my freaking real-estate agent has secure uploads! What existing laws, rules or mechanisms can I realistically use to pressure my healthcare provider to join the 21st century, now that we're a fifth of the way through it?"
legaladvice,[NE] Need help in contract details for tuition reimbursement,"Hello. I recently worked at a company that offered a tuition reimbursement program. There is an issue they told me that is stopping me from claiming the $750 dollars owed to me. 

For information, the contract stated that they would mail me a copy of it after it was signed, but it never was.

They wanted me to send in a grade report that included credit hours, as they would not pay on hours that were dropped, failed, or incomplete. This means a transcript.

They also wanted me to send in the transcript within 10 days after the term ended, which they meant as the end of finals week. That would have been Dec. 30. The online information for the program said 21 days, which was what I used because I did not have a copy of my signed contract.

I submitted a request with my school to send a transcript to the office sometimes before Dec. 30, I do not have a specific date, but am confident the school has a history of my requested transcripts.

Additionally, a transcript before dec. 30 would not have final grades on it. I was receiving emails of grade changes until jan 2.

On jan 2, i asked my store manager where i could send my transcript through electronically. He provided me an email address and i paid to send the transcript in that method.

When I called earlier today, they said I would not be getting paid because I did not submit the grades within 10 days of the term ending. I told them that I sad sent in transcripts through the school weeks prior, and had emailed them grades too, in which I was informed about the limit being 10 days and they received grades from the school on the 18th, and my email on the 2nd. I did not foresee that the school would take nearly a month to deliver my transcript.

Essentially employer is scheduling us for a mandatory time in the office, for various nonsales related activities such as training classes and meetings, that since we are not paid hourly we are working extra hours for free. because we cannot sell the product during this time and hence make our commissions.

what options do I have if any to limit these hours or get some type of reimbursement?

legaladvice,Need advice about Canadian law related to Medical Leave,"My employer has two types of leaves available, in British Columbia.

1. Medical leave of absence (upto 90 days)
2. Personal leave of absence (30 days)

As IVF involves surgery and some down time, I am exploring an option to take 3-4 weeks of medical leave. The clinic is okay to provide a medical note without calling out the specifics of my treatment, as well as on a plain (non clinic letterhead) and if required they might assist in filling out any company provided forms. Since Canada doesn't have any good employment laws protecting employees such as FMLA, I am really confused about how to approach this with my employer. 

My questions are as follows:

1. Am i protected in any way if I share with HR that I need a surgery, leaving out the specifics of the treatment as it is elective?
2. What type of information am I legally required to provide to the HR, while applying for Medical leave? 
3. Are there any protections under Canadian employment laws for full time employees who have spent more than 90 days in a full time position?

legaladvice,[MD] How do you find out what the policy limits are for auto insurance accident?,"I was in a car crash in 2018. The other driver’s insurance accepted liability. I have been doing treatment since - physical therapy, needling, max # of steroid injections and just as of today, nerve ablation. I have one more nerve ablation treatment next week but the doctor has basically told me I’m at the end of the road with treatment, pain has gone on for too long to heal itself and is likely chronic, and I will either need to do ablation every year or so OR get SI fusion surgery. Either way, I’m basically finished with minimally invasive treatments. 

So, I called my lawyer and told him this and he said it seems like we would be in a good spot to demand for policy limits. How do I find out what those limits are? Do they depend on the driver? I was able to find the minimums online but not the limits. 

I’ve never done this before and I’m not super concerned about the money ; I just want to feel better but I’m also curious what to expect. If this is just an individualized question for my lawyer, I can delete this post. I’m just trying to get as much information on my own without hounding him with questions."

legaladvice,Class A Infraction (Traffic),"Hello! 

**Today I received a summons for a month from today for a Class A Infraction - Passing a Stopped School Bus.** 

Edit: I am in Indiana 

I do not recall this incident at all, however my girlfriend works at a school and I used to pick her up from work. The bus drivers all park on the main road right in front of the school about 20/30 minutes before the kids come out without their stop signs and arms extended. They lay on the horn at anyone who passes, which would be understandable, if the children were boarding and they had the arms extended. 

I always go around the block to avoid them, but it's possible I may have driven past one day or even the first time I picked her up because they are parked. 

**Am I at fault if they didn't have an arm and stop sign extended?** 

Dozens of cars pass these buses everyday so I can't imagine they are reporting every single person that passes, and if this many people are passing, it's possible that they see a parked bus without the stop sign and arm out.

I've never been summoned to court and have always held a clean record to my name so this is really frustrating to get get this news. 

**What can I expect?** Will my licence get suspended?

Is there a way I can deal with this earlier than the listed summons date?"
legaladvice,Smile Direct Club Issues. Looking for advice on how to proceed,"I live in the US, specifically Washington state. I started SDC at the end of August using their payment plan which totals close to $2000. I put $500 as a down payment and pay monthly installments of about $85. I was told my treatment will take 6-8 months. 

The first 3-4 months were fine, my shipment came on time with my aligners and other gear. The first red flag was after the 3 month check in, you are asked to take photos of your teeth with the included 'smile stretcher' and send them to your assigned orthodontist to evaluate. I did this and received no reply which didn't bother me too much because I felt like I was making good progress and was fairly happy. Fast forward to last week, I went to put in my first aligner of month 6 but there is no more aligners in the box. While my smile is much better it is not as straight as I was promised. I still need a few months worth of aligners. 

I have reached out to the SDC customer email twice and have not received a reply either time. I still owe money until the end of 2020 but I feel like I am being cheated. I have received no help or follow up and didn't even receive the full treatment plan. Is there something I can do about this with the legal system? I don't want to just stop paying and have negative effects on my credit but I also don't want to pay for a faulty system. 

I appreciate any help you can give me."
legaladvice,What should my Girlfriend (16F) do in this situation?,"Using a Throwaway

&amp;#x200B;

My Girlfriend (16F) is a Canadian citizen here on a O Visa (for acting / songwriting). She is also a freshman at a University (California if it is relevant). She grew up with a very strict mother with strong Soviet/Russian cultural values who tries to impose these values on her. Her father is nearly the opposite and is on her side most of the time, they are currently getting Divorced and he intends to get full custody but that process has just started and takes time. Her mom has tried to make her life a living hell ever since finding her Birth Control (for heavy periods, no illegal activity has transpired), and has attempted to restrict her freedom as much as possible. Today, when starting a job that required her passport, she realized she couldnt find it, and her mom essentially (although not in writing) admitted to stealing her CA passport, US visa, and US Social security card.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

How can she go about getting a replacement to these documents?

Is it possible without going back to canada and missing classes?

Is what the mother did legal?

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

She is fully financially independant and has been for 2 years (pays tuition, food, transportation, etc)

She pays taxes in the US and has copies of her tax records.

She turns 17 in less than a month  (not sure if that grants additional legal rights).

Her mom has tried to drain her bank accounts and other similar actions in the past, so while emancipation would be ideal, it is our understanding it would take too long and be pointless.

Her dad is willing to sign off on whatever to help, his wife (GF's mom) simply blocked him when he asked about the passport.

legaladvice,Data recovery specialist is withholding my broken hard-drive for $800,"location: New York

I took two old, broken hard-drives to a local data-recovery specialist to see if he could recover the data on them. I asked him upfront what his rate was and how much he thought the work might cost, but he declined to give me any numbers and just told me that he is very reasonable and experienced. The only thing he quoted me was a $35 per drive (paid up front but deductible from the final cost) as a ""file opening cost"", and a free diagnosis.

A few days later he calls to let me know that one of the drives was unsalvagable, but that he is making good progress with the other drive and that I should be able to come get the data next week. A few days after that, he calls me to say he can recover almost all of the data from the semi-functioning drive, and that he has put about 5-7 hours of work into ""fixing some issues with it"" at a rate of $150/hr. He said he would only charge me for 5 hours, and when I said that was way too much, he said he would make it an even $800, and that I could pay in 2 installments of $400. I said that was still too much and that I would come by to pickup the drive in 2 days.

When I went to pickup the drive from him he thought i was coming to pay him $400 and get the data. I told him that it was far too much money and that I could only give him $100 on top of the $70 i already paid him...if that was not enough then I just wanted to get the drive back (so that I can try to get it done cheaper). He kept saying that I owed him the money because he already put in the work that I had ""approved on the phone"" (remember, when I last spoke with him on the phone, he said he had already put in the 5-7 hours of work. either way, I never approved that much time and that much money). After a lengthy discussion turned into an argument, he eventually said that I could not have my drive back unless I paid him the $800.

My state (NY) is a ""one-party-consent"" state, so if I had theoretically recorded the conversation/argument we had at his office, I would theoretically have him on tape admitting to 1) doing the work ahead of my approval and 2) telling me that I would not get my drive back unless I paid him $800.

I have no idea what kind of law this falls under or what to do next.  I guess what I'm wondering is...

1. Does he have any legal standing to hold onto my drive?
2. What's the best way to go about getting my drive back (without paying a ridiculous amount of money for services I did not approve)?"
legaladvice,Having a hard time picking a car accident lawyer,"Hello there Reddit! I'm a male in my twenties and I had recently been involved in a car crash in pinellas county, florida as another driver went a red light. I was immediately transported to the hospital and have spent the past week laying in bed and not doing much of anything else other than seeing the chiropractor once due to my pain levels (thankfully, no fractures anywhere). The other driver received a citation for going a red light and was determined as fault, however, with no injuries.

I have been having an incredibly hard time in figuring out how to choose a lawyer to deal with my case due to the fact that it's a freebie case where I am a young driver who was determined not to be at fault. I will potentially face life-long back pain as explained to me by my chiropractor, and would like to get any extra money that I can in order to allocate towards chiropractor adjustments and physical therapy as these can be VERY expensive at over $100 an hour. 

I have talked to bigger law firms, where I came to find out I would not be able to speak to a paralegal, and people have told that they can settle cases quickly because insurance companies are afraid of them HOWEVER they can close a case prematurely due to feeling they have made enough money on my specific case, without too much care for me as an individual and my condition.
 
Medium sized law firms were described to me as having a decent amount of reputation, enough to make the insurance company get things done, however, I will not be able to frequently talk with my paralegal, and he as well will likely feel as though the case isn't worth pursuing at some point, and may choose to pursue me to settle it. 

Finally, the little guys/attorneys with their own practice were described to me as having little pull, but having the patience to fight on my behalf to their best of my ability (although they may lack the experience)."
legaladvice,"[Los Angeles, CA] tenant paid me with Zelle and the name doesn't remotely resemble theirs","I posted this on r/RBI, and it was suggested that I post here also. I'm reproducing my original post:

&gt;I just got new tenants through a management agency. Everything checked out--great credit scores for mom and dad who moved in from another state and live with a kid, acceptable bank reserve, deposit and first month's rent done via cashier's check, one-year lease signed.  
&gt;  
&gt;They just paid their second month's rent with Zelle, and I received an automated email. The amount is right, but the sender's name on the Zelle payment doesn't remotely match the tenants'. It's not even a derivative. Management company reached out to tenant to check, and tenant said yes, that's correct, and confirmed the name on the originating bank account and said he sent it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I called my bank, and they have no information to provide except for the confirmation of the sender's name on the Zelle payment. They cannot tell me the originating phone number or email address associated with the sender's Zelle account.  
&gt;  
&gt;A quick google search reveals the Zelle sender's name seems like a real person living in the same county as the rental property, but there certainly isn't any clear connection between the name and the renter.

My legal question is: am I obligated to investigate the discrepancy between the Zelle sender name and the tenants' names further, or do I accept the payment at face value? Furthermore, could it be construed as an undue invasion of privacy if I *do* request an explanation for the discrepancy?"

legaladvice,Small claim: defendant requesting evidence before trial,"I have a pending small claim for which I’m the plaintiff and the defendant is a property management company responsible for managing the bank-owned property next door to my home. Today, ~~six~~ 13 days before the scheduled hearing, I received an email from the defendant’s legal department requesting evidence that I referenced in my statement of the claim - specifically photos/videos, which I offered them when the incident first occurred, but they never requested before denying me reimbursement; a description of events and timeline, which I sent them via email when the incident first occurred, and which are also included in the statement of claim (albeit abbreviated); and a copy of my original email correspondence with their team. Obviously the latter two they should already have, but it seems as though they either misplaced or haven’t shared with their legal team.

I’m immediately suspicious of their intentions, given their previous lack of cooperation, which led to the claim in the first place. On the one hand, they might be seeking this information for use in a settlement offer, but on the other hand, I’m concerned about “showing my hand,” so to speak. Obviously IANAL, but it sounds a bit like Discovery to me, of which, my state’s (MA) small claim standards note:

&gt;Discovery is not available in a small claim except by leave of court ""for good cause shown.” Uniform Small Claims Rule 5. The court may allow discovery if it would provide material assistance to the court in deciding the case. See G.L. c. 231, ss. 61-69. If the court permits discovery, it should closely monitor the process in order to prevent confusion or possible harassment of an unrepresented party.

I called the District Court, but they weren’t of much assistance, saying that they’re unable to offer legal advice (granted, I think this is more of a procedural question).

Should I share any of this information with the defendant prior to the hearing? Even if they’re operating in good faith and are interested in brokering a settlement, we’ll have the opportunity to meet with a mediator on the day of the trial, prior to meeting with the magistrate.

legaladvice,"Work for a small business in NJ, went from being paid weekly to whenever.","Hello. I'm in a frustrating situation. I work for a small business in New Jersey, and have been since October of last year, and it had been going so well I even got a promotion here and left Amazon for this job.

We do things legitimately here, I signed tax forms and get taxed appropriately as required by the federal government and the state of New Jersey. I had been getting paid weekly since the day I started, but as soon as 2020 rolled by, the owner has been ""forgetting"" to sign our checks to the point where our manager had to sit him down and discuss direct deposit options with us, which he agreed to, and we have so far only gotten paid twice this month. This week I asked the owner twice about if we're getting paid this week and as of writing this I have not been paid, and for every delay I get vague answers along the lines of ""I was busy"" or ""the accountant isn't responding to me"" and every time I request my pay stub, he says he'll do it and never does.

Why am I still working here? Because this wasn't a problem until 2020 arrived. There were 0 issues with payment until the new year, we got paid every Friday since I started, and I am overall treated very well here, far better than I ever was at Amazon. If the plan is to switch us to biweekly pay, this has never been discussed or addressed and I have never agreed to it.

One thing to note is we are a total of 6 employees, and the accountant is not someone on site."
legaladvice,Inheritance laws regarding spouses &amp; stepchildren,"My mom recently found out that her grandmother owned mineral rights to 120 acres in an oil rich area in southern texas. To our knowledge she had no will.
Her heirs included her two sons, (my mothers father and his brother), her grandson (D), my mother, and my mother's niece. My mother is my grandfather's only living biological child. My grandmother had 3 children at the time she married him he never formally adopted his stepchildren, and left behind no will either. We also believe he did not know the land in question existed. 

Recently an exploration company contacted my mothers uncle (H), wanting to drill on this land. They offered to lease the property to drill for three years at $500/acre. Theu planned to apportion a certain amount of acreage to each heir and pay them their percentage of the total lease.
The contracts they sent out portioned 9 acres to my grandmother, 16 to my mother, 7 to H, and the rest to D.
After my mom signed and sent in the lease, the rep called and said that her brother claims he actually was formally adopted, and that he would be getting 11 of her 16 acres. They told her the lease she signed is still valid though, even though it states she would be paid for 16 acres. I should note: all parties involved except my uncle live in Oklahoma, but the land is in TX.
So here are my questions:
1. Does my grandmother have any right to any part of this land or it's profits? My gpa left no will, and neither did his mother. Oklahoma does not have a community property rule but Texas does. It seems to me that she shouldn't have any right to it since it didn't technically come in to his possession during their marriage. 
2. Can my uncle claim any of this property without proving he was adopted (we are 90% sure he wasn't,  especially since the other two children where not and my gpa pretty much hated my uncle.) And also is it legal to give the adopted child more than double the amount the bio child got?
3. Should anyone besides H even get anything since he is her sole living direct child?"
legaladvice,Moving out on sublease because of mold and bedbugs. [TX],"Hi, 

I'm on a lease for an apartment. My roommate and I split 50/50. There is bedbugs and mold. They've tried addressing both but they still exist. 

They sent pest control to treat for bed bugs 2 weeks ago. We found another bug Sunday and they've not replied to our notification yet. If they don't do anything by next Sunday, what is my course of action? 

For the mold, they painted over but it has since returned. I believe it is caused by a leak in the apartment above mine. I've notified them of this today via email and asked for read receipt. 

There are several more unaddressed issues like 
Exposed drywall on ceiling after paint fell off all over my clothes,
Lock not working properly (notified 2 months ago via email) requiring force and two hands to lock. 
Broken screen door for balcony
High kwh usage due to energy inefficiency and fireplace vent hood broken and not closing


Do I have grounds to move out? Does it require both my roommate and me to move out? Or can I break ""my end"" of the lease. 

Any advice is welcome."

legaladvice,[CT] Restaurant is claiming we are making hundreds more in tips than we actually are,"It hasn’t just happened to just me, but multiple people working here as servers and bartenders.


Back story - restaurant group with multiple restaurants in state and one out of state got audited in 2018 and had to give out new W2s and fucked all the servers up with their taxes and made them owe THOUSANDS to the IRS because of their fuck up. Company owed a lot of money when they got audited bc they “weren’t claiming” everyone’s tips

So come to this last 6 months, I’ve noticed that my paychecks were 0 dollars and my claimed tips (CC and cash) were super high. We get a printed out slip when we clock out for our total tips of the day, sales for the day, tips for the week, and sales for the week. I’ve been keeping track of my end of week tips and they don’t match up with what’s on my slip for the end of the week. (Ex. My paycheck said I made almost $600 more than I actually did a couple weeks ago and almost $300 more this week and was taxed on it) Everything is done automatically on the computer for tips, so when someone does payroll for the week they must be manually entering a higher number for what we make. It’s happened to a lot of people. Just now we’ve been collecting our slips and comparing it to our paychecks. We’ve told our manager and owner about it and they always say they’ll “fix” it but nothing happens. I’ve gotten a “you’ll pay less tax next time” but I dont think that’s possible or legal. And bartenders can’t completely tell if they’re being fucked or not because they pool in tips and they are split into who worked that night and they aren’t able to know how much exactly they made in a night until the next day.

A group of us have been talking and getting angry that what they’ve been doing is illegal. What are the next steps we can do to protect ourselves from paying so much tax for money that we don’t even make? Don’t know if a lawsuit would hold up because we can’t access the payroll on the computer or company email."

I did find that Florida restricts the working age to 14 but am I missing anything that would allow this to work? It would likely be 5-8 hours on the weekends cleaning up and helping me with basic maintenance around the farm.

to Washington State Law, vehicle must yield when the
pedestrian is within one lane and a half of the roadway

by the officer, which I later confirmed on the government website). The police officer was behind me as I was turning right and it is possible that he wasn't able to correctly evaluate the distance between my vehicle and the incoming pedestrians.

legaladvice,Questions about a land contract,"We live in Kentucky. My daughter and son-in-law are having issues with a house that they are purchasing under land contract. The situation is a little complicated. 

First of all, a little back story. The owner - Sally - inherited the home from her mother. Her mother had been using the house as a rental property in the past. Sally took over the house and also used it as a rental property. The latest tenants were drug users and were not paying rent for a long time. Sally is elderly and had a lot of difficulty trying to force these ppl to pay rent. She basically just gave up and let them live there for free. They stayed in the house until they were raided by the police for drug use. 

So, Sally is tired of dealing with the house and renters. The house is in bad shape. The druggies did damage to it and repairs that were done on the house were awful and just lead to more damage. If I'd been asked for my opinion, I would have told my daughter not to get the house. However, in a matter of a couple of days they saw the house, agreed to a land contract and found a buyer for their trailer. At that point, they felt locked in to their decision. 

The price of the house was originally about 45,000. However, since there were so many repairs that needed to be done to the house before my daughter and her family could move in, she told Sally that they would have to negotiate the price of the house and bring the price down. The last agreed upon amount was 37,500. However, Sally stated that they could continue to negotiate the price because so much money was being poured into the basic repairs on the house. It isn't like there was a promise to reduce the price of the house - I'm just trying to state Sally's frame of mind on the house. She was sick of dealing with it. She just wanted someone to live in it because it had been empty for a long time. She didn't want to see the house that belonged to her mother rot. She was very willing to negotiate to make the land contract work for my daughter. She just didn't want to deal with it anymore. 

Nothing was on paper. A contract was supposed to be provided, but it didn't happen. The only thing on paper was a document filed with the water department that stated how much my daughter was paying per month for the house. The agreed upon amount was $200 until February (to give them a little more money per month to put into continued repairs on the house) and then $250. It also says that if they do not make their payment on the first of the month, they'll have to pay an extra $50 per month. 

Sally was very nice to them. Gave them an air conditioner and some supplies that she had to fix the house. All of the contact they had with Sally was verbal. Sally apparently had heart surgery. Her daughter, Lynn, returned to the country and took over the house. Lynn is now making changes that were not agreed upon. 

She raised the monthly rent from 200/250 to 319. My daughter refused to pay the 319 until February because they have a document that proves they were supposed to only pay 200 until then (it also says $250 starting in feb., but...). Apparently, Sally must have a home equity loan on the house, because she has a payment of $379 per month. Lynn is angry that my daughter's payment is less than Sally's payment to the bank. But that is what was agreed upon. 

Lynn is also changing the terms of the agreement. She is trying to change how much the house is being purchased for. She is also adding interest to the land contract - 6%. There was never supposed to be any interest. 

A balloon payment is coming up on the house this spring. The original verbal agreement was that after the balloon payment was made, the title would be put in my daughter and her husband's names. Lynn said that: ""She (Sally) made sure that you got the house under land contract before letting me refinance it in my name."" Basically all communications with Lynn are through text and my daughter has all of the texts. Lynn has stopped all communication between my daughter and Sue. 

We just want to know if my daughter has any rights in this situation. They made a verbal agreement and began doing renovations on the house immediately because they needed to make it livable as soon as possible. The actual land contract and the signing were promised to be just around the corner, but then Lynn came back and everything changed. 

My daughter and her husband have put $10,000 into this house. At this point they are leaning towards walking away because of the stress of dealing with Lynn and all of the ways that she is breaking the original agreement regarding the house. Lynn has a lawyer and a contract has been drawn up stating payments of $319 a month and 6% interest. My daughter and her husband have not signed this contract."

legaladvice,Headed to divorce but wife started a new business and may not be able to refinance,"My wife was making just over 6 figures last year. Her company was shut down by the FTC. Instead of getting a new job, she started a business with some of the people she worked with previously. The business is promising and they already have several clients, but they don't make enough yet for her and her partner to make a paycheck, instead they have to pay their 2 employees first until they hit a certain amount.

At the same time, we are starting the divorce process. We have decided she should keep the house but she most likely won't be able to refinance due to no income yet and we've read you have to have 2 years of income for being self employed. Is it still considered self employment with a new company and a partner?

For divorce agreements I am considering being paid out my equity without a refinance. We have enough savings that I could take a bigger chunk to buy me out. But that doesn't remove me from the mortgage. Is this a big risk? Are there options for her to refinance sooner? Would a few months of pay plus savings be enough proof for a lender?

legaladvice,"Apartment lease says we're tax exempt, but now being charged?","Hey y'all.

So I live in NYC with 2 other women. Our apartment lease is coming up and we all want to renew. Thing is, under the renewal lease papers we got, we're being told that part of our rent increase is due to ""4.21a tax benefits clause"" (some confusing NYC law to encourage landlords to build affordable housing, but I really don't understand it). 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at our original lease though and there's a section explaining if our unit is 4.21a applicable, and that whole section was X'ed out by the guy who did the lease signing with us. I called the rental offices and explained and they were like ""That's weird but yes your unit is 4.21a applicable."" My feeling is that, since it wasn't on the original lease, it's an oversight on their end and we shouldn't have to pay the part of the increase due to a clause that someone fucked up on.

Tell me, do I have any legal right to not pay that portion since it's essentially outside of the terms of the contract I originally signed under? Or will I just be charging myself up to get fucked over by the realty system."
legaladvice,Please help me figure out the best approach to this issue with a mechanic? Thank you ahead of time..,"Good afternoon all, 

My Corvette is in the shop (State - Florida) with a manual clutch issue. 
The mechanic given the job, has worked on the car before.. 

The car was taken to the same shop 14 months ago for the same problem. 
Back then the clutch was replaced with the same one, a ZR1 manual clutch, installed in a Z06 Corvette.. 

14 months ago, was told by the same mechanic in email, text message, and over the phone, that the clutch pieces being 
replaced were under warranty. 
This same mechanic ""stands by his work"" and claims also warranty for his work. 

The corvette was taken back to his shop 6 weeks ago, after having only driven the corvette for 300 miles for most of last year. 
He reminded me that it should be no lem if it is those parts, because they are under warranty. 

After what seems like a ""fishing expedition"" to find out the problem, he finally takes everything apart and says 
that GM does not warranty a part meant only for the car it was build for. 

He has been in business for more than a dozen years, races Corvette, but yet acted surprised to only recently find this out. 
So the bottom line, he wants me to purchase the clutch and pay for his labor like as though there was not warranty.
 
I obviously do  not want to pay for something I was told had a warranty, something that gave me piece of mind. 


Additional problem - 
I discovered that:

(1) GM does not warranty clutches other than against mechanical defects


I would like to know what options do I have now? That is, even if GM does not warranty this part, I should pay for his ignorance? 
Should he not pay for the parts himself, learning from his own ignorance? What about his labor? 

Thank you very much for your assistance with this."
legaladvice,Neighbor knowingly gave me a couch that was bed bug infested. What are my options?,"Ive been dealing with bed bug bites over the past 6 months or more.  It started when I saw a couple in my apartment complex putting a brand new looking couch out by the garbage area (where a lot of people put out unwanted furniture for other residents to take. I asked them how come they were getting rid of a new couch and they said they were just getting new furniture and they encouraged me to take it when I looked interested in it. They did not, however, mention the fact that it was bed bug infested. About a week later I started getting bites, and at first I thought it was mosquitoes but then I realized what the problem was when I saw shedded exoskeletons on the couch itself. Ive dealt with it the best I could with home remedies but nothing has helped,  and my last resort would be to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars to get an exterminator. THEY KNEW there were bed bugs on it. Why else would they be getting rid of a really nice couch and replacing all their furniture. I feel like an idiot for not realizing it at the time but it all makes sense now.  What can I do in this situation? Can I sue for damages? Should I press charges? I'm so sick of living like this."
legaladvice,Tenant keeps delaying eviction and new home owner can't move in,"This is a throw away account just in case.

We are landlords to a tenant and his family living in a home (Toronto, ON) that we've now sold to another owner. We haven't had good relations with this tenant and were relieved when we got an eviction order to allow the new owner to take the property. However, the tenant complained about the judge's handling of the hearing for the eviction, saying he didn't receive proper evidence of the sale (which he did) and wasn't allowed to cross-examine us and got an appeal, so the order was stayed and a new hearing had to take place after 3 months. The new owner had already sold his previous home and we've had to pay rent for him and his family to live somewhere while we deal with this issue.

Come the new hearing, even the judge was surprised as to why this has been pushed so far and dismissed the tenant's claims and appeal and was ordered to move out immediately, saying he's had plenty of time to consider relocation and find a new place. One day before we were to get the sheriff to evict him, we received papers in the mail directly from him about another appeal to the superior court for a new hearing in 6 more months! The reasoning listed was for the same reasons as the previous appeal which is bs honestly. This man is clearly taking advantage of the system to keep delaying things and causing both my family and the new owner's family a lot of distress. We cannot continue to pay rent for the new owners and need this dealt with ASAP.

From our experience and what we've read online, being a landlord in Ontario is awful as it usually favours tenants and cases can drag on like this leaving only the landlord losing a ton of money while the tenant can live care free for years at a time. It's sad to know that when he finally gets kicked out, he won't be punished in any way. There has to be some sort of justice right?

EDIT: Just realized that the superior court appeal paper we got was just the tenant's application and the 6 months date was his suggested date for the next hearing. Do we still have power to evict him or move to get his application denied?

"" When an appeal of an order is filed with the Divisional Court, the order is automatically stayed...""

Our lawyer says the best we can do is file a motion to dismiss the appeal and would take at least a month or two. We hope to sue for damages after this is all taken care of. I cannot get to every comment but thanks to everyone for their help ."
legaladvice,Roomate recorded without knowledge!,My ex borrowed my indoor security cameras  to watch her roomate. She hid the camera on top of the fridge and pointed towards the couch where her roomate was sleeping/living. The roomate found out about the camera weeks after and has the video files on the sd card in the camera. We live in florida btw. They just had a falling out and she wants to know if my ex can be arrested for recording her without consent. Thanks for any advice! I also had a bad falling out and wouldnt mind her getting charged if the action was illegal.
legaladvice,Venmo holding my $ to settle an issue with another user (State: CO),"We had someone do service at our home and paid them via Venmo.  Immediately after we sent the transfer (we had paid her via Venmo in the past) she told us she forgot to tell us that she switched to Zelle and to resend as she can no longer access her Venmo account.  So we put in a request to stop the payment in transfer with Venmo and sent the money to her via Zelle.  

Venmo refused to reverse the payment.  We called them and they said they would not reverse the payment without permission from the recipient.  The recipient emailed Venmo approving the reversal.  Venmo came back and told her they would not reverse the payment to me because they have an open dispute with her (the recipient). 

It turns out that someone hacked her account and she was in the process of disputing about $600 in charges with Venmo (reason her account was frozen and she couldn't access it).  When my payment came into her, they applied my $ to her open dispute debt and now refuse to reverse my payment.  Basically using my funds to collect on their issue with her. 

Has anyone had experience with this?  Do I have a path to get Venmo to address this or am I stuck working this out with the recipient?"

legaladvice,Receiving a Parking Violation for Covered Plates (Nyc),"Hello everyone, as title says. Yesterday I received a ticket for covered plates.

I’ve never had anything like that. To me this guy is just trying to get over. 

I’m definitely going to dispute. But was wondering how I should go about it. I tried to upload photos before but my posts were removed. So if anyone would like to see my ticket and plates with a blur, let me know how to properly post links here lol

Thanks in advance.

Update:  I flagged a traffic cop and asked him to clarify the description for me. He says it’s basically as it shows. Plastic cover on plate. I then show him photos of my plates and he says he’s not sure why I received that ticket. That to tell judge or something and walked off."

legaladvice,[USA] [Pennsylvania] Is my wife's employer allowed to make her pay for training required for employment?,"Here are the facts, wife works for the YMCA as a teacher assistant.

3) The employee is REQUIRED to pay $15 PER session, no reimbursement is provided.

legaladvice,Medical Billing Issue: Threatening Collections,"(EDIT: I live in California)  
So my daughter is under my insurance and had been seeing (psych) Dr. #1 (in 2017) at a certain medical group.   After more than a year, Dr.#1 moved and she started seeing Dr. #2 (in 2018).

We paid our copayments and insurance information did NOT change.

Then in 2019, we get a bill for several thousands of dollars, with the medical group saying insurance won't cover and the balance is our responsibillty.

When I check with Insurance, (and review EOB- explanation of benefits), it states that the provider has submitted claims after more than 12 months and services no longer qualify.

It seems that Dr.#1's claims were processed and paid (all timely), but Dr. #2 waited beyond the allowable time to submit the claims.

My question is: Am I legally liable for the amount owed, if the provider fails to process the claims in a timely manner, given that I indeed have coverage that would have paid for the services and the provider's failure to receive payment was due to their delay in processing?"

I have copies of the registration but can't find the title. Me and my family are debating on giving it to a charity or hauling it down to a pick a part for a few hundred bucks. I know I can probably get the title and everything from the DMV, what I would like to know is if we need to go to probate to get it one of our names. I've looked online and found conflicting answers and am unsure where to go from here. Especially because I know different states can have different laws. I'm also worried because one of the articles I read on this said that I would have to have changed the title over in the year after she passed. There is no disagreement in the family about someone else wanting the car either, so that's not an issue.

legaladvice,Test came back positive for Hepatitis C a year after taking same test,"I'm not sure if this is legal advice or not but here goes..

In October 2018 I took an STD test where hepatitis C showed reactive.  I was called in to take a more accurate Hepatitis test and got the results in a few days and was told verbally that I was NOT positive for Hepatitis C.

Throughout the year I've had a wide range of medical problems.  Most recently I came down with a stomach flu and decided to get an STD test again.  The test came back positive for Hepatitis C again.  They told me they'd retest me using the same blood so no need to get blood work done again.  This time they informed me that I was Hepatitis C positive and recommended me for treatment.

The difference in the viral load was:

* In 10/2018 a viral load of 2.7 was discovered in my first test.
* I don't have the results for the second test that soon followed (the one that confirmed I didn't have it).
* In 01/2020 a viral load of 3.0 was discovered.  
* I don't have the results for the second test that soon followed (the one that confirmed I have it).

Is this malpractice??  I get the feeling that someone dropped the ball somewhere in that first test but I don't know what the cutoff of the viral load is to warrant treatment.

We had already decided that we were going to get a loan through our bank because the broker has been super awesome through the whole process. However, he does not deal with 203k loans, so we contacted a broker our real estate agent told us about. I am super busy with work and school so I asked my SO to contact her today. I am not sure exactly what happened during their conversation, but my SO mentioned to me via text that this lady asked how we sign our names. I am assuming this is for electronic signatures. I found out that she also pulled our credit.

legaladvice,"Bought expensive item at auction, person I agreed to sell it to backed out.","Throwaway account.

This takes place in Illinois.

I'm posting this here because, while I don't think I have a case and am just SOL, I want to make sure I don't have any legal options.

I love antique watches, really nice ones (around the $50k range), and I often find myself on auction and purchase sites looking for one to buy, though up until this point I have never pulled the trigger and bid. This past year I made a decent sum of money through some stocks and decided it was time to sell and buy something nice for myself. Enough money to buy a particular watch that I've drooled over for a long time. This watch, however, is particularly rare, and very old, such that the only examples I've found were either completely trashed, or way too expensive. Until last May, when on an online auction site, there was one offered that was not quite what I wanted, but a similar model. I wanted to bid on it, but I was somewhat concerned that I wouldn't be happy settling for something different than what I wanted.

Then I had an idea--I went to an antiques store near me that often deals in valuable jewelry, and that I had visited a few times before to look at watches. I talked to the salesperson who I know best, mentioned what I wanted to do, and asked if, I got the watch and I didn't want to keep it, he would consider buying it off me to sell at the store. He said that the arrangement would be ""something he would be interested in"" and that he would ""help me out,"" should I not want the watch after buying it. I even mentioned how much I paid, worried that I might not get that money back should I no longer want the watch, and he said, ""I wouldn't worry about it.""

So, I bid on the watch, and ended up in a bidding war and paid quite a bit more than I was expecting, though still within my means. It came in the mail, and although it arrived as advertised, it became clear I should have held out for the exact model I wanted. Plus, some unforeseen personal expenses made me less and less comfortable with keeping it. I asked the salesperson to move forward with buying it, but now he's saying that it would be a difficult sell because one can look up the price it sold for at auction, and that no matter what he did, there would be no way to make me whole, except for possibly a consignment deal for much less than I paid (which is not okay, because I could really use the money now).

Is there any way at all that the legal system can help me, or am I just SOL? I wouldn't have bought the watch without him having promised (at least in my mind) to buy it off me should I not want it, and while this is a valuable watch, the market isn't nearly big enough for me to sell it privately or auction it again."
legaladvice,[PA] Opposing lawyer falsified evidence. Next steps?,"I apologize for being vague, but there's no way to guarantee that the subjects of this won't read this post.

Obviously we will be providing our lawyer with the certified, unedited documents we recovered, but this conduct can't be allowed to stand. Do we also submit our evidence that the opposing lawyer acted unethically to the state bar association, or is there someone else we would be better off notifying?

Edit:  It is not actually an opposing lawyer, but rather a guardian ad litem in a custody case.

legaladvice,"My former apprentice is saying I illegally logged into his Facebook. He left it open and the open messages revealed my business partner (LLC) and apprentice's nefarious plan to give me the boot... or ""feed me to the pigs"" as their messages said.","I co own a piercing and tattoo shop in Ohio. Today was my day off and my daughter (who's a piercer) was working the shift. She went to make a post on Facebook on the shop owned computer. The (now former) apprentice had left his Facebook logged in and on the messages page. The conversation open was a group chat and she saw my name and the suggestion that the best way to get rid of me was to ""feed me to the pigs"". 

Concerned (and since it was on the company computer) she read the entire message exchange. Seems my business partner is sick of piercings making the lions share of the business (I make all the piercing profits, he makes all of the tattoo profits - the last 6 months of 2019 piercings were stellar). He wants the piercing side of the business back. My apprentice is unhappy with the contract he signed and wants more money. (Mind you, his contract is up the end of this month and he would have gotten a significant raise). So my business partner has been stirring the pot and telling lies to the apprentice and his girlfriend (who is the other tattoo artist besides the owner) and now they want rid of me to reboot the shop and keep my piercing clients that I've built up over the 4 years I've been there. 

She took photos of the messages and called me at home. She was the only one there (my business partner has been scarce here lately). She read me the messages from the screen shots while I drove to the shop. Is her reading the messages and taking screen shots on a company owned computer illegal?

Here's the gyst of the conversation: 

I'm a bitch, a thief, greedy, unfair, a gypsy with a grift (I'm racially a Romani and Romanichal), other racially charged pejoratives... 

Plan A is to feed me to the pigs: my business partner often talks about ways he would dispose of a body. I doubt it's a serious threat, but who knows these days. Should I report this to the police? 

Plan B is what he's started to implement. Get a new EIN. Dissolve the LLC behind my back, keep my stuff, convince my daughter to stay (but somehow that would make her homeless), and once everything is lined up, give me the boot. We have an LLC with a buy out clause and both parties must agree to dissolve it clause. Can he legally squeeze me out? Don't we have to ""liquidate""?

I got to the shop and my business partner was at the desk eating his lunch. When I walked in, he was shocked to see me. He asked me why I was there. I told him that the apprentice hadn't learned to log off Facebook on the shop computer, that I knew everything, and the apprentice was fired immediately. 

He tried to say he'd tried to talk to me about things not working. Then he tried to say that no one could stand me in the shop. Then he complained that I bought a house and a car last year (not sure what that has to do with anything). Then he whined about not having enough tattoo artists and how it was all my fault. He complained that I only work 3 days a week (my daughter works the other 3) and how he's been in this industry for 25 years and he still works 5 days a week to make ends meet and how I just wanna sit back and collect my money and only show up part time. He also says he's already contacted our landlord to sign a lease only in his name. Can he do that if we have a lease (all be it month to month) under an LLC? Can he sign a new lease with another LLC name but keep all the other property that the other LLC owns? 

Let me digress a bit. He broke up with his live in and she moved out around September, but he was unhappy for most of the year last year. To ease his suffering, he started buying things... a lot of things... on credit. He even refinanced his car as collateral for a personal loan. Then she moved out and he is stuck paying all the bills at his house plus his part at the shop. He's been sporadic about coming in and often reschedules or cancels his appointments. Because of this, I've paid all the shop bills for November, December, and January with the agreement that he'll make it up to me when tax season hits. 

The beginning of this month, when I was reconciling our bills for the shop I found money transferred from the business accounts and into his account after he'd already been paid. I also found that he drained the account that our sales taxes were in. He was in charge of paying those because his mom is a book keeper. He also wrote his rent check from his house on the business account.  Is this legal? Is this embezzling? What happens with the unpaid sales taxes? 

His plan was to keep saying he was broke and have me pay all the bills and him pay none and then fuck me over. He left and I reconnected the cameras (that he'd turned off yesterday... they'd discussed it in the messages so I couldn't see them doing things on Sundays. 

I've called an attorney and left a message. Hoping to get an appointment later today. I also went to the bank and they're looking into the transfers for me. I copied all of our financial paperwork since I started there in 2016. I copied our LLC paperwork. I called the landlord and left a message. 

Answers to my questions, suggestions on questions to ask the attorney, and any other advice is much appreciated. 

Edited to remove apprentice's name.

Edited to add that I just discovered he's taken out two loans in the shop's name. 

TLDR: Read the title and add partner might be embezzling and not paying sales taxes. Upset that I make more than him and wants me out."
legaladvice,Real Estate agent advising we don't tell Lender (Ne),"Long story as short as I can make it: 
We were supposed to close on a house this Tuesday. We are using a VA loan.

This is the 2nd house we've attempted to close on that had a crazy issue so I think our realtor is just trying to help us move in as quickly as possible...but she told us not to tell the lender and we would just push the closing until repairs were done. And we'd essentially ""rent the house"" and move in while repairs are done.

The rest of us have trickled in to help take over other tenants that have left in the middle of the lease. 
I only plan to stay for a temporary amount of time until I can find something else and something better. The lease finishes soon, and the person who already is on the lease says he already signed paperwork for a year long lease with our names.
I did not consent to this, and plan to leave in the next couple of months, likely March. Will the leasing office bind me to an apartment without my consent? We are already over-charged every month for rent, the apartment managers are shady. ( $2,400/mo to get mugged on the way to and from work, regular break-ins and police activity every day and night)
How do I make sure that I am never stuck with this apartment and can move to a new apartment in March without issue? How do I protect myself in this matter?"
legaladvice,"[Mass.] Unemployment Appeal Hearing, upcoming","[Massachusetts] I voluntarily quit my full time job, on good terms because I was offered a 6-Month (W-2) contract-to-hire at a GREAT company, with pay boost. The employer I left was not doing well and had extremely high turnover, while not rehiring to supplement. Everyone was happy for me and seemed like a no-brainer career opportunity.
  
What was supposed to be a 6-Month minimum (W-2) contract-to-hire, ended after 7 weeks due to budgetary changes. I was disqualified for unemployment benefits because, 1. Recent employment &lt; 8 weeks and 2. Because I voluntarily quit my full time position.   
  
After a 2 month wait, I finally have an appeal hearing. My question: is this going to be a tough case to prove? I have paper trails showing expectation of the new contract length and high probability of subsequent hire. My former, full-time employee will not be present (they didn't respond in time).  
  
I appreciate any and all advice. This has been a tough financial hit and a fair amount is at stake. Trying to get my expectations right."
legaladvice,[GA] Reimbursement process is taking months. Do they owe me interest?,"So I’ve been waiting for a large reimbursement that I spent on funded travel for work. I submitted and approved of the numbers months ago. I’ve let them know that I needed the money the beginning of this month to cover rent and while that seemed to speed up the process (I saw a notification on the webpage but no finality of the process), they still haven’t reimbursed me. I’ve since had to take a loan to cover the missing funds for my living costs. By the time they reimburse me, I’m going to have to pay interest on the money I had to loan, money I should have had in hand already. 

So my question is do they owe me interest? How do I make sure they do if that’s the case? 
Have any tips on how to speed up the process, regardless? 

Thanks in advance!"
legaladvice,"Gave out a small personal loan to a friend(6k), they haven’t been paying me back.","As title says, I gave them a small loan and they agreed to pay me 250$ a week until it was payed back, with a 1000$ extra (making the owed amount 7k) for the use of the loan at a lower rate than a bank.

I wrote up a contract, we both have copies and signed it as well as pictures of us holding the contract in our hands from the date I gave him the loan. If he doesn’t pay me back, what legal action can I take to get my money back?

legaladvice,Need Help Dealing With Parents,"So, some context. I'm 19 in Nebraska and decided to not go back to college so I can work and figure out what I want to do.

The problem I am having is that every time I want to try and leave and go to my own place far far away from here they say theyll report my car as stolen along with my paid off phone, the ps4 they gave me as a gift, and the laptop they gave me as a senior gift.

legaladvice,"Sue my local PD &amp; DA office? Takeover armed robbery (gun used), suspect identified, no consequence.","My jewelry store was robbed 9 years ago. We had the best security system, got their faces, and they left finger/palm prints on the glass counters. Gave all the evidence (video and DVR) to the police when asked. We lost almost $1mil in jewelry, and had no insurance coverage at the time. The local PD claimed the prints had ""not come back with a hit"" from DOJ. In 2018, they got a hit on the palm print. Turns out, one of the 2 guys who robbed us was incarcerated in state prison since 2012. When they robbed my store, I turned around and had a gun in my face, was beaten, zip tied at my hands/feet, pistol whipped repeatedly trying to perhaps ""knock me out"" and lose consciousness, and dragged by both men into the back. It was the most brutal takeover armed robbery in my countys history. The DA office mailed me a letter identifying the suspect by name, and stated they would not be proceeding with any prosecution because the ""statute of limitations had ran out"" (statute of limitations in CA is 6 years for robbery &amp; kidnapping).   


The DA office should have taken the surveillance and finger prints/palm prints to file a ""John Doe"" warrant for the suspect when &amp; if he was identified later, therefore having no issue with ""statute of limitations"". I spoke to the DA, and he blamed the local police department for whatever reason. I feel my local DA office had the responsibility of handling the biggest unsolved robbery in the history of my city/county, and it would have been VERY simple to use the crystal clear face and body photos of both suspects to file that John Doe warrant. They let this happen. The DA office is the reason the person who changed my life and my family's life, FOREVER, will never face a single judicial consequence for their actions. In a city plagued with corruption, I'm not willing to just take this and sweep it under the rug.   


I want to sue the DA office and the local police department for their failure to take the steps necessary to ensure prosecution would proceed when &amp; if the suspect was identified. I was hit with a gun in the head and face well over 30 times. The police never cared, they did not publish the surveillance photos of the robbers for over 30 days, telling me they ""didn't want the suspects to know they were looking for them"". That was, and still is, the stupidest thing I've ever heard. My local DA office was responsible for filing the John Doe warrant and ensuring thsi man never escaped the consequences of his actions. He was in prison (state prison) since 2012, how on earth did they just get a hit on the prints in 2019? This is not okay. His prints were undoubtedly in the database since 2012 when he was incarcerated, the fact is my local PD did NOT follow through with investigating this case just like all the rest.  


As I said, corruption in my town is beyond rampant ranging from the police all the way through the district attorney's office. My local PD had 3 officers caught trafficking cocaine on duty. The local police swept our fire chief's hit/run felony dui under the rug and the DA never prosecuted him, only charging him with a drunk in public when he struck a car while intoxicated with witnesses saying so. Our DA was the longest reigning DA in the history of the state, and was forced to resign in 2013 due to his sexual involvement with a woman he granted immunity in a murder trial to, and the city paid out $155,000 in settlements due to a ""sexually charged"" work environment that the DA was accused of. Our local police are on so many steroids, and find it humorous when arresting people for similar/lesser offenses. The level of corruption here is one thing, but failing to do your job as a public servant taking an oath to uphold the law is another thing. Do you guys think I have a case in regards to the robbery which happened at my jewelry store? Again, the DA office is the sole reason this man is able to walk free. He can walk up to the front door of my store when he's released and there is nothing I can do to ensure justice is served. The DA office dropped the ball on this and mocked me when I mentioned proceeding with prosecution, telling me to find what will ""make me feel better"". The entire PD mocked and taunted me and my family after the robbery, saying we were committing some insurance scam and offered NO apology after they realized we had NO form of insurance at the time. Too much is too much....  


 Please, someone give me your advice and let me know what kind of attorney I need to proceed with any case if I have one. Robbery was in 2010, suspect identified in 2019. A gun was used, I was zip tied at the hands and feet and they never filed a kidnapping charge because I was not ""moved from the premises of the crime"". Please, someone help.

legaladvice,GM denied repair under service contract,"I have a service contract/protection plan issued by my local GM Dealer. The contract expired when the mileage reached \~100k.

I brought my vehicle to the dealer at around 99k miles because it was consuming excessive amounts of oil, usually on long road trips.

The dealer said everything would be covered since I raised the issue before the service contract expired.

The dealer told me that standard procedure involved logging the oil level each time I refueled the vehicle, over the next 2000 miles. Then, they told me, just to be safe, bring it back after 1000 miles, just before the warranty expired.

I filled out the log for the next 1000 miles, during which I drove no long distances, and noticed no excessive oil consumption. I figured if I showed them the log at 1000 miles, they would resolve the case, say there was no issue, and my warranty would now be expired. So I opted to drive the full 2000 miles, during which I would be taking a road trip.

After the road trip, excessive oil consumption was apparent, I brought the log back to the dealer, and as I'm sure you can now guess, GM denied the repair under contract because it was now expired and because I didn't follow the dealer's instructions to bring it back after 1000 miles.

Will this be a simple case in small claims?

P.S. This happened last year and I never got the repair. Last week I received a letter about a class action lawsuit for excessive oil consumption in 2013 Chevy Equinox (among others), with my VIN that said the repair would be free. I thought I finally could get this fixed. However, upon closer inspection, the lawsuit is only for vehicles with the 2.4L engine, and mine is 3.6L. Now I really want this issue resolved. I will never buy another Chevy. Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

legaladvice,[FL] How much compensation should I be asking for from a company?,"My last post didn't really go anywhere, but to cut a long story short, I have finally moved through the process and an insurance representative is speaking to me now.

I had to pay out of pocket pay for doctor and prescription, and I had to miss work to do all this.

The rep just asked me what I am looking for in compensation. I need help factoring in what else would be fair to ask for. The doctor and prescription ended up together being about $360, so that's my minimum what I want back, but I'm not sure if I could potentially be getting more for the missed work, and the fact my productivity went down because my fingers were throbbing and bleeding, which made it hard to work.

legaladvice,(SD) Not being notified of lock removal on apartment storage locker.,"Hello! I live in an apartment in South Dakota (here for college, not from the state originally) and I'm renting an apartment that comes with an outdoor storage locker. We put a lock on the locker and kept some things in there (such as a tent and our christmas tree). When we went to put our tree away earlier today, we found that there was a temporary ""lock"" on our locker. The lock was a carabiner, some zip ties, and a metal wire. I called my landlord and she said that locks were going missing (we are responsible to buy and put locks on them) so the maintenance guy would put the new ""lock"" on so the doors weren't flapping open in the wind and damaging other lockers.

The thing is: we weren't informed that locks were going missing (nearly all the storage lockers have these makeshift locks on them)  and she said to check the locker to see if our stuff was there but didn't provide any other help. We haven't checked the locker yet, we both have classes soon, but are planning on checking if our stuff is gone later. What is there that we can do? The landlord has not been informing residents (I assume, but since they didn't tell us about our locker I'm assuming the same went for everyone else) that people are more than likely breaking into these lockers - since why else break the lock off?  How would we report stolen property to the police if we don't know when this even happened? Are the landlords in any way responsible or anything? They never informed us people were breaking locks off lockers. If I need to clarify I can, I'm trying to type this up quickly before class. Thank your for any and all help.

EDIT: our brand new tent and some other stuff is gone. We got robbed. At least $100 worth of stuff."

legaladvice,Where's the line on infringing on someone's logo? (example in the body),"This is a repost because I (unintentionally) broke some of the posting rules in the title of my last post. 

I was browsing an individual's online t-shirt store which has several designs centered around a particular niche. One of the designs caught my eye because it's obviously used a portion of the logo from a large company. The the logo has been altered somewhat and the company that it belongs to is in a different niche than the company who is selling the t-shirts. However, the seller of the t-shirt is absolutely using the brand recognition to sell their t-shirt. 

One additional point to add is that this individuals store is part of a larger online retailer who provides print on demand services. 

How is this allowed? Would both the seller and online retailer get in trouble for this? Can anyone just alter a logo and call it a ""parody""?

legaladvice,"On insurance of a car I no longer own, owner had accident and now my insurance premiums with my own insurance have doubled. Do I have recourse?","I signed over a car last year to a relative.

I gave it to them in July, and signed all the papers in October. 

I got a new car this week, and when I applied for insurance I discovered that they got in an accident in the car this month and now my premium is doubled because apparently they never filed anything or removed me from the title, and they never removed me from the joint insurance. 

I informed the insurance company in July 2019 that I no longer lived at that address, and was told that I wasn’t eligible to be insured if the car wasn’t there, but apparently the homeowner never confirmed that the vehicle wasn’t there anymore, so it was never changed on the insurance. 

I no longer live in that state, I don’t have access to the car or home, and due to legal issues. I can’t get in contact with the relative anymore either. 

The insurance companies are telling me to just dispute it with a consumer reporting agency. 


Do I have any legal recourse? Civil suits are so expensive and I really don’t want to be out of pocket on a lawsuit if I can avoid it.

Is there any kind of legal charge associated with this? 
Is it fraud? 
Can I file charges for them keeping me on the insurance and car without my permission after I signed the vehicles over?

legaladvice,Potential Housemate took deposit and has been unresponsive since,"Hello, please let me know if I wasn't clear enough :( 

I currently live in a 3bed and it costs $4900. The master tenants moved out in Nov, and so my other housemate (#1) and I decided to remain in the home and try to fill the master room ($1900). My current housemate is not on the master lease, as he had no credit when we originally applied, so we added him as a subtenant after we got the house. Our rent check must come from a master tenant (myself or the previous couple who lived in the master bedroom). We couldn't find anyone and now have to pay the $4900 rent two ways for Dec, Jan, and half of Feb. I wrote the check for Dec, and will need to for Jan and Feb. #1 still owes me $900 for Dec rent (his half of the $1900 master) and for Jan. He also should pay me for half of Feb. My housemate (#1) refuses to pay his portion, causing me to be out &lt;$2.5k. ($900 for Dec and Jan; and like 800 for Feb). 

Now, because  knew I needed to find a new place, I started looking and found a room a few weeks ago. She seemed great (#2) and I paid 1/4 of a deposit to secure the room ($625). The total move in cost would be $2k deposit and $1150 for first months rent (Feb). Well, I didn't see my housemate (#1) not paying me back, so it left me in a negative (I have very little savings right now - different story - which is primarily being used to pay this current rent). I told the new roommate my situation and she kindly said she would work with me. 

Well, that was a week ago. Yesterday I texted her to see if the new payment plan would work. I would basically fully pay her back for the $2k deposit and $1150 rent before the end of Feb (maybe mid March) rather than the beginning of Feb. She now wants new conditions (i.e. I cannot move in until the end of the month) because she wants her money before I move in. The issue is, my current rent is expiring soon so I don't know where I would go for two weeks (in the end of feb) if I can't move into her room? 

Given that I could sense she was uncomfortable, and I don't want to start off living with her on this wrong foot, I offered to help her find a new housemate before the end of the month. She hasn't responded back to me. I'm willing to even let her keep a portion of the $625 if we can't find someone by Feb 1st, but she's not even giving me the opprotunity to. 

I guess my concerns are doubled. How do I get my current roommate (#1) to pay me the rent he owes? And also, how can I ensure I get my $625 back from (#2) if she refuses to let me move in? 

I know I put #2 in a bad position, but that was only because I didn't see #1 not paying me back. Now I feel like I'll be out &lt;$2.5k+ for one room and $625 for the other. I'm so stressed and don't know what my rights are. I think I have a good chance at winning in small claims court with #1, but #2 and I don't even have a lease. It's all been texting back and forth as evidence a ""lease"" agreement was ever in place. 

What can I do? Specifically, how do I get my $625 when I don't have a proper lease to sue her?

She didn’t know that her real name was Rudyveca for a very long time, she went by her christian name, Rebecca. All her accounts are under Rebecca, her drivers license is under Rebecca, everything is under Rebecca. Since then she’s been married and widowed, so her last name has changed. Now, in 2020, she went to renew her drivers license (in Texas, now) and they said her name doesn’t match her birth certificate. Social security told her she needs to match her name to her birth certificate. If she legally changed her name to match what she’s used everywhere for years, will that fix her problems?

While doing so, I ask what the dosage is. Doc tells me that it is X dosage, which surprised me because I had remembered a higher dosage at my appointment several days prior. Doc tells me that it's normal, and administers an injection. I then roll up the sleeve for my other arm, and Doc tells me that there is no second injection. I tell Doc that in the previous sessions, I got two injections (one in each arm) and ask what the reason for the change is. Doc tells me that I get only one injection, and shows me the vile from which the injection came. It has a different set of allergens than the one I had seen previously, and upon closer inspection it had a name listed that is not mine. Doc says ""this is your vile, yes?"" to which I reply ""no, that is not my name"" and she gets upset and begins apologizing profusely. Doc then calls the previous patient into the office, asks previous patient to wait in an adjoining room, and gives me the additional (correct) injections. I then think back to the full interaction with Doc, and recall that she did not verify my name, DOB, or any other personal information before administering the medication. The rest of the day I have been at a loss for how to feel, and what steps to take next.

legaladvice,Can a landlord withhold packages?,"[Minnesota] I order meds through my insurance that I receive in the mail. My apartment complex has a concierge that accepts packages that wont fit in the mailbox for you. My building is a half mile from the office and I am disabled,  I can't walk long distances or drive. 

Often times the meds are something I will need that day, so when I get a notification it's been delivered to the office, I head over there (even though I have my preferences with usps set to not send it there). But the office has to ""check the packages in"" before you can receive them, and that often take *hours*, when I usually need my package as soon as I can get it (especially if I order faster delivery, the time of day MATTERS.) 

There is only one time of day I can hitch a ride over to the office and when I get there I usually get the ""we're checking it in, you'll get an email when it's ready.I can'tjust check yours in because then I'd have to do the same for everyone"".

So they HAVE my mail, often times easily visible so I can see my actual package sitting there,  and they refuse to give it to me until *they* want to. Which I feel like isn't ok to begin with, but then you add disability accessibility to the mix and it seems like that can't be legal, can it?

I provided a 30 day notice that I am not renewing my lease and I will be moving and provided the forwarding address. My landlord called me and said that i probably won’t be getting my security deposit back. I paid $1225 in total as a security deposit and we’ve never broke or damaged anything. My landlady is stating that if the baseboards aren’t scrubbed and the floors are left unwaxed, etc, when we move out, the deposit is forfeited. She then sent me a copy of the lease. The only thing it says about the security deposit is “the deposit will be forfeited if the unit is not left as it was when you moved in”. I know in Texas it says they can’t charge for normal wear and tear but can my landlord withhold my entire deposit because I didn’t scrub the baseboards and wax the floors before I leave?"

legaladvice,Lyft Situation,"Hello. I am on vacation in New York, and went out for dinner with my friends. We took a Lyft (I called it). At the end of the ride, I realized my phone was missing so I told the driver that I needed a minute to look for my phone. He started getting very upset with me and my friends 5 seconds after I let him know my phone was missing, telling us that we need to “Close my door because I have other customers to pick up.” We were flustered and kept searching, but he kept yelling at us we close the door and let him go. He drove off, but it made no sense because then he would have to meet up with me to return the lost iPhone.

He left, so I didn’t get my phone. My friends checked find my iPhone and OBVIOUSLY, my phone was in his car. I put my phone on lost mode (makes a loud sound) and didn’t get a reply until 5 minutes later, from the next rider. We decided to meet on 13th and 2nd and he said he’d wait there for 10 minutes. My friends and I hauled a taxi and got there ASAP. The rider returned my phone and it was missing its case and the back of my phone was completely obliterated. I was in shock and I asked him if he found my phone like this and he said yes. I was also confused because this happened in the 5 minute span the Uber left and the guy returned my phone.

Lyft emailed me back saying there’s nothing I can do because:
“Lyft is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any User of the Lyft Platform or Services. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We do not procure insurance for, nor are we responsible for, personal belongings left in the car by Drivers or Riders. By using the Lyft Platform and participating in the Services, you agree to accept such risks and agree that Lyft is not responsible for the acts or omissions of Users on the Lyft Platform or participating in the Services.”

Here’s the thing: I knew my phone was in the car. It WOULDN’T have been “lost” if the driver had any kind of driver etiquette and let me search for at least.. 2 minutes or so (logging into iCloud and putting it on lost mode so the sound can play). Why did he want to meet up with me later if I can just look for an additional two minutes?

Anyways, I was wondering if there was a case of any sort here (small claims court). Obviously I would want to sue my driver, but I have no idea what happened in those 5 minutes, to my phone."
legaladvice,"I signed a contract for a local production company in town, I'm not sure it's fully sound.","So me and a few friends were in this local production company a few years back, and had to sign a contract in order to get the film made with them.  We were all starting out, so we kinda had to rely on each other.

Right away, we thought there was something fishy with it.  We live in El Paso, TX, and we did not get the contract notorized at a postal annex.  I don't know if it would count as being signed under duress, but the ultimatum was basically - while we were there at their house - either we sign the contract right there and then, or we just would not be able to move forward with the production.

Honest to God, the contract feels hastily put together and full of contradictions.  But does the contract hold water if it had our signatures despite not being notorized nor having any money changing hands?"
legaladvice,Stepmother changed joint will with my father 5 months before her death,"My father died over ten years ago.

legaladvice,Target charged me for a return check fees without my authorization or knowledge. The target red card team will not refund me because they say they assume I gave them authorization.,"My bank information was compromised online. I immediately called my banks and easily got new bank accounts. The  only problem I ran into is that my target redcard was linked to one of my bank accounts. It was during Christmas and was still able to make three purchases at a store.  I then got a notification on my app that my card was closed and remembered that I forgot to call them to update my banking information. I called them the next day and happily gave them my new account information. The agent said that I had three outstanding purchases that would be deducted from my bank account. Of course because I made the purchases I was OK with them taking the money out. However, what they fail to tell me was that there was a $25 charge for each transaction that I was unaware of. The only reason I found out was because the bank charges didn’t align with the charges on my receipts. Further, I got a letter 10 days later saying that I have fees. But by that point they had already taken the money. They are now saying that I’m at fault and that they won’t return my money because I “authorizeauthorized them to take the fees out”. I challenge them and ask them to validate the recordings with the agent but the supervisor refused to do so. He hung up the car and said there was nothing further that they could do.

legaladvice,Can I fight this unusual &amp; random University charge?,"I attend Illinois Tech which charges full-time students $23,740.00 per semester. Full-time students are allowed to take between 12 - 24 credits per semester. From 01/02/2020 to 01/11/2020, I took a short 10-day intense course worth 3 credits. In total, including this 10-day course and other spring courses, I will be completing 22 credit hours for the Spring 2020 semester. 
 
Since my total credit hours are in the range of allowed credit hours per term for full-time students, I thought I would not be incurring additional tuition charges. However, in turns out that my school is charging me an additional $1,750 for the 10-day course. So my total tuition is $23,740.00 + $1,750. 
 
After seeing this, I went to inquire about this charge at the Student Accounting office. According to some sources (including students and staff), the university decided last minute to charge for the course. Because of the spontaneity of this decision, it appears the school has no legal documentation outlining this charge. Since there are no legal documents, would I be able to fight this charge, or am I obligated to pay since this is a private institution?
 
Side note:
After talking to the secretary at the Student Accounting office, it appears that the school is considering this 10-day course charge as a fee charge rather than a tuition charge. However, the $1,750 charge is officially titled as “Undergrad Tuition” on my school bill. Is there any reason why a school may want to mistitle this charge as tuition rather than a fee?
 
Location: Chicago

Update:

While I don't have any documentation that clearly states that the 10-day course would be free, I did find three specific advertisements of the course published by my school that fail to mention any type of fee. Additionally, I'm almost confident that no type of advertisement exists that mentions any sort of fee. In other words, all the advertisements for the course that existed failed to mention a fee.   

Do I have a chance of fighting this fee if I were to argue that they failed to properly disclose the fee before I received their service? Could I also argue, perhaps, that they mislead me through false advertisement?"

legaladvice,"One of my commercial tenants is running some sort of business from the rear parking lot, what do I do?","Hey guys, I'm located in Los Angeles, CA. I inherited a small commercial property after my father passed away last year. It's a two unit commercial property, one half is a barbershop who's been there for 10 years and the other is a smokeshop who started leasing about 6 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The rear of the building is a small parking lot, accessible only via a back alley. However, it's mostly been empty throughout the years since it's not really convenient for parking.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I went to check up on an issue for the barbershop tenant, and saw that the rear lot has 5 junker cars that seem to have been bought from auction It looks like they're being parted off. There are hundreds of parts sorted on the ground: Bumpers, axles, windshields, airbags, etc. The barber told me that the smokeshop guy started bringing those cars in. 

I don't think he's running some illegal chop shop since the cars have auction numbers and stuff like that written on the windshields and roofs. But either way, I'm not sure how to handle this situation. I just found out yesterday and haven't contacted him yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does he have the right to run a second business (assuming it's legal) from the parking lot? According to the lease, he has access to the lot, if that matters. Should I tell him to immediately remove the cars? Any help would be greatly appreciated"

legaladvice,Slipped on slush outside my apartment while carrying chef knives. Bruised ribs on a landscaping fence and slashed wrist from knives. Can I sue for medical expenses?,"I had just sharpened my chef knives and was headed to work. It had been snowing for the past few hours and still currently coming down. The knives had a plastic guard on them protecting the edge.

I slipped on slush on the walkway and fell sideways, hitting my ribs on some landscape fencing, about a foot tall. While trying to catch myself from falling, one of the blade guards fell off and gave me a two inch, deep laceration to my wrist.

I called my landlord, who was home on the property, who came out. I had hoped to get a ride to the hospital but due to liability they weren't able to. She called 911 for me (since I had to keep pressure on my bleeding wrist) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Ended up with bruised ribs, six stitches and a splinted wrist (which will be getting a cast for a month after the stitches are removed).

While waiting for the ambulance the landlord took pictures of where the accident happened for ""insurance purposes"" but I have yet to hear anything from the landlord since the accident.

I am out of work for ten days, then have my cast for a month. Being a chef, I need both hands to do my job. I only have 50 hours of PTO to use as well.

I've read various posts about situations like this and not sure what my position is. Usually the property manager is good about having snow removal and salt put down, so it's not negligence on their part. It was also actively snowing so it is unrealistic to keep the walkway cleared.

I'm not trying to get rich, I just want my medical expenses and time missing from work paid for. You would think apartments have some kind of liability insurance that would cover incidents like this. I'm not sure if I should just ask the landlord directly about their insurance and if my injury is covered, or if I have to deal with it through a personal injury lawyer. This happened in Nebraska.

legaladvice,"Fiancé and I have been begging landlord to resolve issue with noisy neighbor for roughly 3 months, last night cops were called and his apt was raided and drugs were confiscated. Landlord seems unconcerned over it all and we’re at our wits end.","Hi Legal Advice, first time posting so hopefully everything is formatted okay. This is in VA, for reference. 

My fiancé moved into an apartment complex in late October. I was added to the lease and moved in shortly after in December. 

Not long after my fiancé moved in a man moved in upstairs and was pretty loud. He would play loud bass music that could be heard in the apartment and in the common landing area. He has guests over and they are so loud that they can be heard over the TV or radio in our own apartment. My fiancé contacted the landlord and complained and the landlord said he’d speak with the neighbor. This happened multiple times from November-December, and the noise got worse with each complaint. It went from music blaring during the evening to being woken up at 3-4am every morning.  Our landlord advised us to contact the police next time and file a report. 

On New Year’s Day we had to do so, as our neighbor was throwing a loud party. The officer arrived and asked them to be quiet. After the officer left, they continued to be just as loud and you could hear furniture being knocked over, etc. We notified the landlord again, to no response. 

Several weeks of being woken up and no peace while our neighbor is home go by and we are at our wits end. From what we can tell he’s using his apartment as a studio, mixing beats and freestyle rapping. We’re sleep deprived and exhausted because we can’t relax or sleep through the night. We both go to speak to the landlord in person last Saturday and express our concerns. They mention that they never get noise complaints and due to the concrete walls of the building we definitely shouldn’t be hearing such loud noise. We show them a video of the noise and we’re told we definitely should not be hearing that. They promise to speak to the gentleman above us. 

The noise continues through the week, leading us to last night. He has a guest over at 7pm. The noise and music begins not long after, and it is so loud we can’t even watch a movie. It can be heard outside of the apartment building. It continues for an hour, so we call the cops again. When the cops pull into the lot, the neighbor turns his music off. The officer goes up and knocks on his door, and something happens. Not long after, more cruisers and officers arrive until there are 4 cars and 6-7 officers. We can hear them searching the apartment and see them leave with a large container of what appeared to be marijuana. No arrests were made and the cops could not report on the noise as there was none when they arrived. Later, as the cops finally left we heard them say that what they took was more than just marijuana. An officer contacted me and urged me to speak with my landlord regarding the issue and said that the neighbor admitted to having music on but then turning it off. 

Today, I go to the office to speak with someone about the issue. My neighbor has already been in, and according to the agent, was incredibly polite and told them that he only uses headphones in his apartment. They said it is “he said she said” and that now the videos of the noise are inconsequential. We asked about what they planned to do regarding the situation, as the fact that our neighbor being searched by the police doesn’t make us feel very comfortable with our living environment and definitely not comfortable with paying a rental premium to live in a community that was advertised as professional. Their only solution is for us to move to another more expensive unit. We tried to ask if the drugs found were a breach of lease (which they are, according to the lease) and they said that they wouldn’t know until they saw a police report. 

They seem totally unconcerned with the situation at hand, and we’re at our wits end. Our mental health is shot from not sleeping, we’re worried that our neighbor will be retaliatory because every time we complain he gets louder, and we have no clue what to do. Do we have any sort of legal recourse here? This may be an issue of just waiting and hoping, but I don’t know that we can continue to live like this for 9 more months."
legaladvice,Caught shoplifting at Walmart,"I'll start it off by saying yes, I acknowledge what I did was not only idiotic, but illegal, and hurts the store. I attempted to put a $25 controller in a bag with other things I had bought and tried to walk out. I was stopped before I got to the door. I guess they saw me or I look suspicious because even though I was just arrested for stealing, it's not something that I do. Either way. So I am escorted to a side room with 2 people and questioned. I am taken to jail, and charged with shoplifting. However I'm curious about Walmart's rules in regards to how I was treated by one of the workers.

legaladvice,Penalty for breaking an NDA,"I work in the advertising industry and have recently started working on setting up a consulting business so I can get out of the grind of working in a bigger advertising agency. I have worked for a few different agencies over the years and have signed NDAs with all of them where I have agreed to not take any of their proprietary information (which I haven't). My concern is that most of these NDAs usually prevented me from speaking about the clients I did work for. For my consulting business I would love to be able to list clients that I have worked with in the past as they are quite impressive and would help me impress prospective clients. All of these clients area listed on the agency website's that I worked for so they aren't at all confidential. Now that I am no longer employeed at these companies do you think that listing these companies on my personal website would be considered breaking the NDA? How would they know if it was during my time at their company that I did work for that specific company? What would be the penalty if I did break the NDA in this way?

&amp;#x200B;

We recently purchased a new home (we're in NV, builder is headquartered in PA and incorporated in Delaware\].  Even though we wanted (and could use) an external financing company, we were still ""forced"" (builder required) to apply with and get a credit check with that builder's financing company.  We did so as per requirement, along with doing the same process with our lender of choice.  Home build/purchase process went fine with our lender - no hitches there.

However, in the 8 months of this build/process, we've been informed that the builder's lender has been breached (data) TWICE.  We weren't thrilled to have to apply with them in the first place, we're even less thrilled about that breach news.  They've offered credit protection, etc., won't get into that.  Our request/question to them is ""hey the house is closed, we didn't use your company, delete our records.""  They've replied that they must keep the info for an amount of time for ""federal compliance"" (still getting answer about what and how long, so input welcome on this).

Any pointers, recourse, or info?  We know our data is potentially out there, and will have to deal with that.  We just want this lender to remove our (""unused"") records before they get hacked a third time.  Or a fourth time.  Thanks!

legaladvice,[Maryland] Could these circumstances get a judgment removed?,"I was served with a summons in April 2019 from a debt collector. The summons stated that I could call their law firm and make arrangements prior to court. I called them and we came to an arrangement of making payments until I paid the 1,200 in full. They said not to answer the summons as they would be withdrawing the case. It was my error to believe them, but I had never been through something like this. The money was paid in full by June 25, 2019. I called the law firm again, they assured me it was paid in full and would be sending me documentation and that it'll take a little time before the case is withdrawn. 

The court date was in July and, since MD court cases are public records and mine was still listed as active, I went. The clerk told me that since I didn't answer, nothing had been assigned, and no further action was needed on my part, I could go. 

At some point after this, it seems a new court date was given to the Plaintiff that I didn't know about. On August 15, 2019, a judgment was entered against me for the full amount plus court costs. I called the law firm, who again assured me that I was still showing as paid in full. 

If I had known about the August court date, I absolutely would have gone and shown papers that this was settled. I'm worried that, since they still sought a judgment after payment, they may try to come for the money, again. Is there any way I can get this judgment removed?"

I was working at a restaurant that closed their doors on a Monday. Our payday was that Tuesday. They are a part of a franchise (not large). The owners are separate from the franchise so corporate is basically saying “we can’t help you out kid”. The owners also stated they are filing for bankruptcy. 

As of this week, no one is answering our calls. I’ve been getting conflicting advice from everyone, so why not ask the internet. 

Basically I want to know if it would be worth it to hire a lawyer. This was a minimum wage job and I personally don’t want to front the money for something like this, especially if all it will do is cause unnecessary stress on everyone for no actual payout. 

Let me know if I need to include more information."
legaladvice,"Mom and dad lived in MN, not married but both on birth certificate. She got his approval to move to NE with baby to have a support system and build her savings and now that she’s moved he keeps threatening legal action. He has worse than poor credit, is an addict, an alcoholic, and a felon.","Asking for a friend, long post but highly condensed! S started dating L circa 2014. They were off and on for a while, S fell in love with L’s potential. L is a drug addict, an alcoholic, and a felon with drug and domestic violence charges. S is all about seeing the good in people and giving chances. L was never on any leases because the apartment didn’t allow felons so he lived there illegally. L didn’t have his own car insurance because S could get cheaper rates. L never pitched in for rent or utilities because he is a total piece of shit. S tolerated it and let it slide because L was going to school! Because L was going to expunge his record! L was going to fix his credit! L didn’t do any of that at all. He’s an abusive fucking mooch. L and S talked about buying a house (because you know if you can’t afford rent you can totally afford a mortgage right?) so the deal was S would buy the house, and her and L would split half of the mortgage payment, but also L’s sister F and her two kids B and G would live there and pay the other half! Don’t forget that F’a other daughter would come by with F’s grandson for free daycare and LAUNDRY SERVICES!! Long story short, S became pregnant just before they moved in, and L and F never helped financially. Additionally they ate all her food, hiked up the utilities, and never cleaned up after themselves. After an agonizing year, F and kids moved out but left a mountain of trash in the garage. L developed hoarding tendencies and never helped with important things like the mortgage, house repairs, groceries, laundry, formula, diapers, or child care. He referred to time he watched baby alone as “babysitting” and would often take weekend trips leaving S utterly alone with baby. They were in MN but her family was in NE. She was suffocating and drowning emotionally and financially. She was open with him that she couldn’t afford it and he never motioned to help. She had a house to go to with no rent and free child care but the only stipulation was L was not welcome. They are not married, but he IS on the birth certificate. They agreed that it made sense to get help and get financially stable. He said he understood that her going to NE was necessary and that he would work to save and eventually move there too! But he fought every single thing. Made it so so hard. He was constantly under the influence and caused personal property damage and only officially left after the police had to get involved. S is now in Nebraska with her family and the sale of her house closes end of the month. She is taking a loss on the sale. She has been asking L or clear the garage of his sister’s trash for over a year and finally she rented a dumpster and emptied it herself. He is refusing to pay for it because he said he would do it but needed more time and it was her own choice to rent a dumpster so he shouldn’t have to pay for it. She asked him to take care of a few things that couldn’t be in the dumpster and he said he would so she took them to the place he’s crashing...the owner of the property texted her in the middle of the night saying that they were not responsible for L and that she needed to come get the trash (that L said he would deal with...) or they were going to report her to the authorities. ...she asked L about it and he said that after all he couldn’t help her. ...🙄 after all the shit he has put her through enough is enough. How does she get custody? Can she have custody and child support? It’s not kidnapping because she didn’t run away with baby, it was a conversation they had and he said he understood. He is CONSTANTLY threatening getting a lawyer because he thinks she’s denying him visits by not bringing baby to see him. Remember this man has never provided housing nor food nor diapers. Does not help with medical insurance or bills. Cannot lease an apartment. Cannot secure a loan. She’s tired of him only checking in to say that it hurts him not seeing his baby! Doesn’t she see how HARD it is for him? He never asks if baby needs anything. Has not done anything to improve his situation. She’s tired of him emotionally and financially abusing her. What are her chances of getting court ordered full custody and child support? Would she file in MN or NE? What does she do if she doesn’t know his current address? Can you send certified mail to someone’s work? She would have been fine just walking away but with how AWFUL he has made the move, it’s not fair to society to let him just off the hook, right?"
legaladvice,Hi I posted a little while ago with a throw away but I forgot the account so this is a new one.,"I recently had a medical issue and the cost of all medical related items was 1 million plus total. It’s too long to go into the details but the hospital won’t budge and i’ve exhausted all options. Some stuff happened partially my fault with money and partially bad luck. But in most cases they would right off the amount or make it  a charity case and I would only have to pay a small amount. Anyway my only way out is bankruptcy. Anyway I have a few credit cards so what I did before getting my lawyer. Is that I purchased two expensive cars and then paid off the loans by maxing out my credit cards. I then sold the two cars to my brother so they can’t get repossessed off of my name. He live in Canada as well and that’s where the cars are. In addition I maxed out two other final cards to pay of my mortgage. I have a pretty good lawyer our first meeting is tomorrow. Can I get away with this. I also don’t have student loans.

legaladvice,"Can I take landlord(s) to court? Chicago, IL","For some background, I have been living in my current apartment for about 2 and a half years, never missed rent, apartment is 3 bedrooms and is paid by individual room rentals.

In September, the landlord passes away and the building is taken over by her children and we have a building manager

We've had trouble with finding reliable roommates in that apartment so in late December, the building manager texts me to let me know the landlords decide they no longer want to rent the apartment by room rentals, meaning I can't have roommates anymore, meaning I can't afford the apartment by myself so I ask how much time I have to leave and he replies ""asap"" no written notice.

So I insist that I'd like my $400 deposit before I move out, they keep refusing to give it to me because they've only been making $400-$800 on a $1200 apartment because of unreliable roommates and I insist that it's not my problem because I've been a good tenant and the deposit is only supposed to be there just in case I don't pay rent or damage the apartment. And they keep trying to hold me accountable for my roommates.

I ask to see my lease (I know it's dumb to not have a copy but I asked for a copy multiple times when signing it and afterwards, never got it) and I ask the building manager and one of the landlords at least 3 or 4 times and they never send it to me and keep trying to tell me what's supposedly on it instead.

I refuse to turn in the keys until I get my deposit.
I'm aware that they legally have 45 days to return it once I move out but I don't trust them to do that, the landlords are near impossible to get into contact with, and the building manager seems to have been handling everything and even he's hard to get into contact with.

One day the building manager texts me and tells me that they're suddenly agreeing to give me my deposit as long as the apartment is empty

I moved out about 2 weeks ago

I constantly reach out to him trying to make arrangements to return the keys and he never responds, we finally made plans to meet last Friday, and when we meet, he does not have the deposit, and tried calling the landlord ON THE SPOT knowing that we were meeting and I wouldn't return the keys until I got my deposit, so we agree to meet another time.

Again, I reach out multiple times and they're suddenly trying to not give me my deposit again because it's supposedly been ""erased"" (whatever that means) and claim another roommate wants her deposit back as well (she moved out about 5 months ago) and again, I fail to see how that's my problem and tell them I will not return the keys without my deposit

Today the building manager texts me saying he needs the keys otherwise he will charge me for the days I'm keeping the keys, I ask ""do you want to meet today?"" He says ""yes"" I asked when and where and he didn't say anything until 3 hours later saying I need to meet him ""now"" knowing I live an hour and a half away and threatens to change the locks and hold my deposit

1) they told me to move out with no written notice
2) they won't let me see the lease
3) they didn't return the deposit to my old roommate who moved out WELL after 45 days ago
4) they're threatening to change locks

I have text messages proving all of it

The only problem is that I'm afraid to take them to court because I don't know what the lease says and they tried to imply that I was responsible for the full $1200 of the apartment and I'm under the impression that I was only responsible for MY share because the roommates are supposed to sign the lease with the manager as well (every time I signed the lease there were 3 spots for 3 names) although they won't let me even see the lease so I'm not even sure what it says so I'm not sure what to do"
legaladvice,"Hi, reaching a settlement in California, do I need a tax lawyer? 1099 tax free?","Hi, here is some detail, I was sexually assaulted at work and discriminated for my disabilities of Chronic Illnesses, attempted to be managed out, no investigation was conducted when I complained about the sexual assault, they instead made me confront the male coworker myself, then was attempted to be managed out to the point where I had anxiety attacks at work so I finally was forced to take medical leave again. Well I reached out to lawyers and began this long process of communication, went through a deposition, deposed their HR director, and finally reached an amount to settle. My lawyer said it could be classified as a physical touching injury, because the physical sexual assault magnified my chronic illness symptoms causing me to take medical leave.

Do I need a tax attorney? 
What does the 1099 do with this settlement?
Who decides if I qualify for a tax free settlement? 
I have been on disability since July 2019 and doctors orders until March, will this effect my status or check with SDI?

He has told me on multiple occasions that he dreams of taking one of our guns and shooting all of the bullies. He hasn’t told my parents. We are very close friends and I don’t want to break his trust by telling his parents, but at the same time I am scared he might actually do it.

Our friend lives on site at work, where they have rules against dogs. He is currently planning to be out in a couple of months, but needed a place to put the dogs for an audit. He decided to ask a girl he met at the local dog park, who claimed they routinely fosters animals. They have texts agreeing to length of time, and he visited her house first to make sure it was okay. 

Today, my partner got a call from a pound the next town over in Bastrop (he’s the backup emergency contact on the dog’s chip) stating that one of the dogs was surrendered. They do not have his other dog, and we think the girl agreed to watch them with the intent to steal one dog and dump the other. 

He is on his way to pick up the dog at the pound, but this girl isn’t responding. He has papers to prove that the dog is his, along with her being chipped, but what do we need to get started on to get this dog back? He is in the process of filing a police report, but I’m worried about the police saying it’s just a civil matter and we need to settle it ourselves. I think my main question is should we be looking for a lawyer? 

Note: We are not planning to go over there ourselves, too many bad things can come of that."

Anyhow, I come home Thursday night, she had someone break the deadbolt(apartment supplies deadbolt, and they damaged the door as well doing it) and replaced it. Well now shes refusing to leave and she cant remove me cause she cant pass thr lease requirements. So i talked the apartment this morning and they gave her a lease violation for it.

legaladvice,[Indiana] I bumped someone in a parking lot. Do I need to pay BuyCrash $12 for the police report?,"A week ago I backed up in a parking lot and collided with another car's front bumper. My car has no damage. Her bumper had some small scratches that I can believe are from me. She called the police. They filed a report, gave me a ""buycrash . com"" slip, and told me to give the report number on that slip to my insurance within 10 business days. 

I called the local office of my insurance company today and got transferred and hung up on. They assumed I was going to make a claim and told me I had to do that first. I have no reason to make a claim. I haven't called back yet.

I went to buycrash . com, searched using the info on the slip, and found my report (I guess). The names and date are right and it's a pretty small town, so it seems unlikely that it's the wrong report, but it has a different report number than the one on my slip. Maybe it's an additional number for another purpose? Idk. That gave me pause. But the bigger issue here is that buycrash wants me to pay $12 to see the report. I don't really care about the report. Unless the situation really escalates, I do not see why I personally need to see the details in the report. All I want is to get the report to my insurance company and stay out of trouble. 

Is there something I'm missing that makes buying the report worth it? I can get it to my insurance company without buying it, right? This seems so scammy."

legaladvice,Old Landlord Won’t Return $3000 Security Deposit,"I was advised to post this here. 
We had an awful managements company at our last Brooklyn NY apartment. It was our first apartment ever, so we were pretty naive. 
I was subletting unofficially so I never saw the lease, but I paid some of the deposit. Come to find out later that my friends forgot about the part of the lease they signed where is said we needed to give “3 months notice” of moving out. Otherwise we would forfeit our deposit. I admit I should have looked over the lease upon subletting but I was trusting my friends and their parents who had guarantored to deal with the management company. I’ve learned my lesson on that.
The reason this I’m wondering if we have any claim is because when we realized we had screwed up, we called them and asked if we had totally just forfeited the deposit. And their response was that it actually depended on the condition we left the apartment in. We really put a lot of effort into making sure the apartment was in good condition and made effort to let brokers in to see the apartment as they advise. 
Months later and we received nothing. Did they just lie to us about “maybe” getting it back so we would make their lives easier towards the end of the lease? 
Are they legally allowed to require 3 months notice? Do we have any claim at all to pursue legal action? I know we might just be screwed but I want to know if we have any chance to recoup our loss.

Also, a few of the the other tenants who had not had any lease violations are also struggling to get their deposit back."

Brief history on the son, she hooked up with someone, obviously got pregnant and he dipped. Wanted nothing to do with him.

The point i am getting at is, me being not biologically related to him and not legally responsible for anything with him, am i able to add him to my insurance through my company? If so, how does that work??"

legaladvice,Car Windshield Cracked in Private Airport Parking Lot (Illinois),"Location: Illinois

My family parked our car at a private airport parking lot for 3 weeks while we were traveling. We returned in mid-January and found a massive crack in the center of the windshield. We took pictures of the crack, pointed it out to an employee, and asked to speak to the manager. However, the manager was not in at the time and we were told we could wait a few hours for the manager to arrive or call back later.

I called back the next day and was told by the manager that he had reviewed the security camera and could not see a crack when the car was dropped off or when it was picked up. I emailed him the pictures we took, but he is still adamant that his company is not responsible for the damages. I asked him to email me the security camera footage, but was told that if I wanted to see the footage I would have to come back to the parking lot. My family lives a few hours away from the airport in a different state and I likely won't be able to return to the parking lot for a few weeks.  Additionally, the car is registered under my father, while the parking reservation is under my name.

legaladvice,Financial abuse and benefits claims,"I'm in the UK. My mother in law has recently told us about a letter she has received from DWP saying that a top up payment, of 38.90 week, on her carers allowance is being stopped and that she needs to submit a new claim. 

Looking into the details my wife and I have concluded that a claim needs to be made under universal credit. I completed a benefits calculator and found that she has an entitlement to far more than ~£40 a week.

We attempted to complete a UC claim online and found that husband and wife claims are linked. My MIL believes her husband 'claims as a couple'. So the liklihood is that her benefits are being claimed and paid.

The complicating factor is that my FIL refuses to share financial information with anyone and won't give any money to my MIL or towards food or the upkeep of the house.

All essentials, food and household maintenance are paid for out of the 38.90 week that my MIL l receives directly.

As things stand as of April 1st my MIL is going to lose the only income she has access to. She doesn't know what benefits are being claimed for on her behalf and how much they are, she doesn't know where they are paid or have any access to accounts controlled by her husband.

Based on his behaviour we suspect he is an alcohol and gambling addict - in the region of a bottle of whisky a day and 100 bets a week. What debts he may have or liens against their fully paid house, we don't know.

We've spoken to citizens advice and will be having a follow up meeting next week. They have characterised the circumstance as financial abuse and are going to refer us to resources locally that can help.

My question is what can we do to help my MIL? Can we get her portion of UC paid to an account she controls? What resources should we be looking to access and what haven't we thought of.

I'm happy to provide further information if required."
legaladvice,What liability am I opening my self up to by helping someone stuck in the snow?,"I live in Wisconsin. A few years ago I was helping my apartment neighbor get his car untuck after he tried to drive through all the snow the plow had pushed in front of the parking lot entrance. If you live in an area that gets a lot of snow you know that there are two kinds of people, those who know how to get a car out of a snow pile and those who gun it. He was definitely a gun it, no matter how many times I told him we needed to get a rhythm going. At some point, while me and his gf where trying to dig snow out from under the car, we went inside to ‘get some cardboard’ and came back with a bottle of wine. Now I realize that he had been at least buzzed the entire time and I have visions of home finials getting unstuck and gunning it right into another parked car. That got me thinking whether I could in some way be held liable for any damage he cause or whether, in another circumstance I would be liable for damage caused to someone’s car while helping them out. Any insight?"

legaladvice,NYC- Landlord is threatening a non-payment case from issues before I moved in,"I am a landlord-approved subleaser in an apartment in Manhattan with two roommates. We started getting notices of a ""rent balance"" a month or so after I moved in. Upon closer examination, a roommate who was evicted before I moved in had literally never paid rent?? Only made one payment of a security deposit. The leasing company never brought this up with them because one roommate (still living in the apartment) had paid 8 months of rent upfront and they just seemingly didn't notice??

I never signed a lease, I just got my application approved and started making payments. Am I responsible for this, legally?"
legaladvice,[tx] Feeling threatened by angry neighbor,"Throw away account for clear reasons. I am a woman and months back I met a man named Jim (not his real name) I thought was nice and he would stay over at the house I am a renter of a couple nights a week. Through Jim I was introduced to other people with the same interests and they would also come over and crash at my house from time to time. No more than three days at a time, four at the absolute most almost always. 

This Wednesday I found out Jim was doing things with someone I did not approve of and we had a loud argument. It got out of hand and at some point we were outside and he was getting physical, I felt the need to defend myself and used a taser on Jim as he was being very loud and was threatening me. At one point the taser was knocked out of my hands and it broke, I needed to defend myself so I ran three houses down. The neighbors there (who has never even introduced themselves) has this ugly clay pot on their brick mailbox. It's big and an eyesore, but in that moment I was so threatened I wanted to try and pick it up and use it to defend myself. It was pretty big and they had not secured it at all so when I went to pick it up, it fell down in the street and broke. I was able to pick up a shard of it to defend myself from Jim. 

Eventually the police were called and Jim was removed. 

I went and picked up most of the broken pot but I guess there was a little bit of soil left. 

Yesterday I was leaving for work in the morning and as I was backing out of my driveway, there was the neighbor I don't even know his fucking name. He was taking out the trash and when he saw me he just stopped and stared at me. I honestly thought I was having a panic attack the way he was looking at me. I was literally shaking and he just crossed his arms and looked at me and then looked to the street where there was still a pile of potting soil and then stared straight at me. I gathered my composure and backed out of my driveway and went all around the neighborhood to avoid driving past him, I honestly feel threatened by this. I don't know why he's this weird and upset, the pot was basically junk and in that moment I was under duress anyway.

Should I file with the police in case they try and do something? I am already working with them trying to get a restraining order against Jim and another unrelated (well, mostly) individual. I know that with family members or people like Jim who sort of lived with me I can get a good amount of distance with a RO, what could I do here?"
legaladvice,Did I just ruin my life? Misdemeanor possession of Marijuana.,"Long post ahead! I’m a college student(Business admin major) in Illinois  looking to get into the finance world so I applied to some entry level jobs at different banks. I got a call back from Chase and got an offer for a PT teller position and in the offer letter I was told I had to get fingerprinted. I remembered that I also got printed when I accepted an offer for the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago back in 2016 and the offer was rescinded due to my background. I was in so much shock I didn’t even ask why. Dumb move :( 

When I was 20 I was driving though Oklahoma and was pulled over and got charged with a misdemeanor for possession of marijuana less than 1 gram and for drug paraphernalia, as well as driving without a license and no car insurance. I got locked up in the tiny county jail for like two hours and was released and told to come back for a court date. Went back and plead guilty don’t know why!! I was alone had no help and my dad had just gotten deported to Mexico. I was told I had to pay fines but I was in community college and completely broke and didn’t pay and never went back to Oklahoma. When I pulled my rap sheet it says Arrest disposition: referred to DA only by two charges driving w a license and no car insurance. Does anyone know what that means?? Then secondly what are my odds of getting that teller job at chase with a misdemeanor? My record is spotless after that misdemeanor that I occurred over 7 years ago. Any advise is greatly appreciated!!"

legaladvice,Woke up to a parking ticket.,"Yesterday I woke up to find a parking ticket while parked along the curb in front of my apartment. Now technically I was aware that the rules of the apartment complex state that there is no ""street parking"". However we have two vehicles and all the extra spaces the complex provides were taken up so that I had no choice but to park in the street. There were approximately 15 or so other vehicles also parked in the street, all had tickets on their windshields. I have lived in this complex for almost two years and have parked curbside many times and have never received any tickets. The only sign posted against parking was posted by the apartment complex and not by the township, it also mentions nothing about a possible fine, only that the car may be towed at owners expense. My question is can the ticket, which was issued by the township be enforced if there is no local ordinance prohibiting parking curbside, as well as zero township posted signage indicating no parking?

- The divorce was a dissolution.
- No kids are involved.
- It does not state anywhere that we need to abide by anything. 
- I'm not sure if this one is relevant and I understand it the least but, the papers were served to my ex as a summons (family law).

2nd Edit: The way it was explained to me, was that if my ex did not respond to the summons within a certain time frame then the divorce would be filed automatically. And that is what we did. So with that in mind, he didn't actually sign anything."

legaladvice,[Maine] Is it legal to receive a liquor shipment through a whisky club service in my state?,"Hi r/legaladvice!  Slightly different from a lot of the types of questions I see asked here, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  Recently, I've been getting spammed with ads for what I guess is some kind of ""liquor of the quarter"" club (not sure if it's okay to post the name of the company here).  I usually try not to get sucked into ads, recently I decided to check one out and made it part way through the sign up process, expecting them to tell me ""sorry, we can't ship to your state"" or something like that as soon as I put my Maine address.  Being under the impression that it was against state law to ship hard liquor (or beer, or anything other than ""wine"") *to* Maine, I was very surprised when this did not happen.

A quick Google search turns up results like [Title 28-A, §1403-A](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/28-A/title28-Asec1403-A.html) which are referenced in other places (like this [NCSL article on Direct Shipment of Alcohol State Statutes](https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/direct-shipment-of-alcohol-state-statutes.aspx)) and seem to indicate that shipping liquor to Maine is not legal, regardless of how you do it.  Nevertheless, when I emailed the people at this whisky club and asked them how they were able to ship to Maine, since I was under the impression that it would be illegal for them to do so, they responded that they ""collaborate with many vendors all across the US that fulfill [their] orders and can also legally ship to Maine.""

Is there any possible way that this is true?  Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how it could be.  Also, if it is illegal to send a shipment of liquor, does that also make it illegal to receive one?  That is, would I personally be breaking any laws by receiving a shipment of hard liquor within the state of Maine?  Not that I'm considering doing so, just curious.  (Also, before anyone asks, I am over 21 and can legally purchase alcohol products in the state of Maine).

About a week ago a unit in my building at a GA, USA apartment complex fought fire. Luckily nobody was hurt and moreso, my unit was spared any damage. As of today there has not been an official cause to the fire, but the workers at the leasing office are stating that is was not the apartment complex at fault. There was damage to the electrical wiring of the building and now the complex wants to move everyone from said building to different units in different buildings. We have been assigned to unit that is over 200 square feet smaller than the unit that we signed the lease for. They are now telling us that we have to pay the same rent for a unit that is significantly smaller because the fair market value of this smaller unit is higher than the rent for our original unit when the lease was signed. They are framing this as if they are doing us a favor. My roommates and I are living at hotels and our parents houses for the moment. We have no idea as to what our next move should be. Is it legal for our complex to do this. Should we talk to a lawyer? We have very little disposable cash to spend and it feels like this complex is trying to get everyone to move quickly to sign a new lease for the new unit that will either end when out original leases end or sign an renewal (at our original rate for the larger unit). We have no idea what recourse we have. Tough circumstances dictate that we have to make a final decision ASAP. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
legaladvice,Car Bump,"Hello Reddit peeps,

Unfortunately, I was involved in a small crash today. I was pulling out of my parking spot and my car (SUBARU) and this girl makes a sharp right. We were both driving at about 3 mph. I honked and she did not notice and still continued to drive forward, crashing into me in the process. She looked distracted and seemed to be oblivious when she was driving. The aftermath was a cracked bumper on my end and barely a scratch on her car (Dodge). We got out of the car and exchanged information. I took pictures of the scene and got a voice recording of her and our whole conversation. Which in the process she admits her fault for the accident. 

My questions are:

1. I want to keep my car's record clean. How do I do that?
2. I was thinking of just asking her to send me a check (obviously more than what the repairs would actually cost for the inconvenience and she keeps a clean record) and all is done and I do the repairs myself. 
3. If I send the car to Subaru or a Body Shop. Will that show on my car's record?
4. If you were in this situation what would you do? 

I apologize for the vague nature of this post. But tbh this is my first time dealing with a situation like this. This car is my pride and joy and I worked my ass off for the past two years to buy it in full. Its just unfortunate since this situation could've been avoided if she was just paying attention."

Through quick internet research i found out that where i live you are only insured with your parents insurance while you are still in your first education. I already finished that.
I did not take care of an own insurance since I need all of the money I make just to live and eat.

What should I do now? What would it cost to give her the money out of my own pocket? The MacBook Pro was purchased in 2013. It looked like it was in very good conditions but it was still used for six to seven years. It can't cost that much, can it? I couldn't find out anything about the value of a used 2013 MacBook Pro in the internet. What should i Do? Can you help me?

legaladvice,Girlfriend terminated from job due to pregnancy related issues.,"So we live in Florida, I know it's a right to work state and all, but do we have any options here?

About a year ago my girlfriend and I had a pregnancy loss due to a medical issue. Not your normal miscarriage, but we discovered she has a condition where this will happen every time we get pregnant without the proper medical procedures and care. We're pregnant again, and at 12 weeks of this pregnancy, she had to have a surgery which put her out of work until further notice. FMLA kicked in at her job, which apparently only protects your employment for 12 weeks and then they're allowed to terminate you. (First question, is that how this truly works? Can she really be terminated because a doctor is keeping her out of work?).

She was ""officially terminated"" on January 9th. Her company told her her short term benefits would continue until she was able to go back to work medically. She just got a call from her short term provider who said shes no longer entitled to her short term disability benefits because she was terminated, and that's how her policy between her employer and the short term provider is worded. Is this for real? Isn't that the whole point of a short term plan?

Should we be contacting a lawyer right now, or is that all on the up and up and just how it works? It seems real shady to be, but obviously IANAL."

It’s an hour and a half drive to my friends, and they never let me go out because it’s too far. I’ve never misbehaved either. I’m no longer allowed to see my ex stepdad who basically raised me (more than my real Dad did) and my Dad now wants full custody of me even after my mom gets out. Remind you this place is absolutely horrid, and my mother and i have a very close relationship. They think i was in a toxic environment and that they are helping me, but quite honestly i feel like the toxicity here is far greater, as well i don’t feel like my moms house was toxic. Me being a late teen and being isolated from everyone feels like prison on its own. On top of that I’m very behind in my school and going down to live back in the city and go to a certain public school is the only thing that can let me pass this grade, though if i told my Dad i was behind it would be absolutely 10x more miserable. My moms boyfriend is great and is a teacher and wants me to go to the school he teaches at to get me caught up, the only thing is my Dad won’t let me stay, nor will my stepmom. They think they are doing what’s best for me but i hate it here so much. I just want to go back home. Does anyone have any idea how i could get them to let me go back, how to go home and go to public school, or how maybe my ex stepdad or my mom’s boyfriend could take legal action? Please."
legaladvice,My Brother used my name in a traffic stop,"Location: Vermont

My wife and I received our auto insurance renewal and noticed a huge increase in our premiums. I saw the word ""citation"" next to my name in the insurance paperwork. I haven't had a speeding ticket in over 10 years.

After calling insurance, DMV, and the Judicial Bureau I was able to get a copy of the ticket that was issued back in July. The ticket was for a 52mph in a 35mph zone in the next town over from where I live. The ticket was contested and the defendant never showed up to court. It turned a 100 dollar ticket into a 250 ticket.

Turns out my Brother, who hasn't had a license in over 10 years, was driving my parents car and gave my name to the officer when he got stopped. This isn't the first time this has happened and I honestly don't know how he can get away with it.

I'm currently at risk for losing my license for the unpaid ticket and am now paying hundreds more for insurance.

What is my next step? The issuing officer no longer works for that police department and I want to press charges and get reimbursement if possible.

legaladvice,[VA] I am a high school teacher and one of my students is facing deportation.,"I will try to summarize this as best as I can. I am hiring a lawyer for a consultation and need help understanding the process, what questions to ask, and anything else I need to be doing. Below is the backstory. We all have certain feelings about immigration... I just want advice.

Background:
-17 years old, turning 18 in 3 weeks
-From El Salvador
-Picked up illegally crossing the border in September 2017
-Sent to live with his dad and brother who he did not grow up with 
-Seeking asylum as a juvenile (I360- petition for special immigrant- juvenile)
-Received I-797 Notice of Action Feb. 2019. Master Hearing was supposed to be on 1/23/2020, but was cancelled. I don’t know why and his lawyer has not told him. When I called the number to check on his status, the recording said there was no upcoming hearing, no clock, and the judge made a decision. It didn’t indicate what the decision was.

This kid has tested out of ESOL services, is ranked 15th in his class of over 600 kids, has started clubs, sits as an officer as clubs, has a 4.0, and has never received any disciple referrals (not even a tardy). This is a young man who I want in my community and makes everyone around him better. He has a bright future and is being recruited for college programs already- and he is facing deportation.

-What is the next course of action?
-What can we (his teachers) do to help his case?
-Is there anything he should be doing or absolutely not do?
-Does his status change when he turns 18? 

I don’t know if this is good or appropriate or the right place... but the more I read about immigration law, the less I understand.

Appreciate it-"

On the cd case, we have a little ‘©my band name 2020, all rights reserved’ etc. it’s pretty generic, but it’s the verbage seen on most professional cds. Do we need to take any more action to protect our music, or is there a copyright that takes place when the music is recorded? I’ve heard both from different people and I’m curious. The band is not a legal entity as of right now."
legaladvice,[US - FL] Company is deducting cost of a mistake from my wife’s paycheck,"Wife works for a Real Estate Legal firm in FL. Today it was determined that a clerical mistake was made in a recent contract that had the incorrect closing fees for buyer and seller, and now the party that overpaid wants a refund. Her boss informed her that, since it was her mistake, she would be required to repay 1/3 of the total amount being refunded. 

My wife is a paralegal, and she is responsible for filling in the details before a closing. However, all contracts are submitted to her boss, a lawyer, who approves and issues the contract. The issue was missed by all parties before and during the signing. 

Are they allowed to take the funds out of her next check, assuming the deduction doesn’t drop her below minimum wage for the pay period?"
legaladvice,School Bus Trouble,"Hello! I go to school in Dayton, Ohio and on one of my friend’s buses, the bus driver kicked off a student before his stop. The reason for this was that the bus windows were fogged up from the rain, and the kids were writing some supposedly bad words on the windows. The driver stopped the bus, pulled over, and began to lecture my friend on why she shouldn’t write on the windows. The boy who was eventually kicked off stood up for my friend, as she wasn’t a part of the problem. The bus driver, getting angered by his apparent arguing, kicked him off about two stops before his stop, leaving him to walk home in the rainy weather. He had not caused any big commotion, or threatened to cause harm to anyone on the bus. We plan to compile evidence (videos) and talk to the school administration, hoping to get the driver fired. Are there any bus laws in Ohio that could help our case? Would this be considered endangering a child? What would be the best way to go about making a case against the driver? Thanks for any possible help! 
This may seem trivial, but this bus driver has been causing problems and we are taking this very seriously."

legaladvice,Vehicle issue,"
TLDR: Ex has been driving my truck for years. He’s buying another vehicle and I want to take my truck back.

My [39F] Ex boyfriend [45M] and I have been broken up for a couple of years now. During the last break up (there were 2 break ups in 13 years) I let him use my truck. After a while I realized it wasn’t coming back anytime soon so I asked him to just transfer it into his name so I wouldn’t have to have him on my insurance anymore and also to not have the vehicle in my name in case something happened to it while he’s driving it. Even though he’s an insured driver I didn’t want any problems. I’d signed the title over so he could transfer it but he didn’t do that and he held onto the title. He’d give me a hard time and act like he didn’t have to do anything because he had the title. He refused to transfer it for 3 years. Now he’s getting a vehicle and he said he wondered how much he could sell the truck for.... he thinks it’s his to sell. He’s under the impression that because he handed over 500 for it that he owns it. Immediately after the 500 was paid, the same day, I had to sell my other truck to make up for the lack of funds ( he lost his job that day too so there were no funds to be spending the last 500 on a broke down train wreck) I sold the other truck that day for 500. In the weeks following I paid for the removal of 5 pounds of sugar in the gas tank. $500. My family paid for the Transmission rebuild 1800 and the Engine rebuild $1500 (both the 1800 and the 1500 were loans that were to be paid back by him since he was, at that time, claiming to the the owner of the vehicle. He did not pay either loan back)... and front end work $600. (In addition to vehicle funds.. over the years another 10,000 had been borrowed that never was paid back.) In a few years he killed the transmission again. And the truck was in over all crap shape. I broke up with him and offered the truck to him. He told me he didn’t want it and to come get the piece of Crap and a P.O.S IT WAS! I ended up  replacing the transmission again $2000. And Drive shaft, radiator, tires. Another guesstimated combined total of  3-4000 Etc...  so.. so far I’m about $12000 into it. (I had to cover the unpaid loans of his to my family once he and I broke up and they knew the money wouldn’t come from him. THEN, we got back together. As the transmission was being installed in my truck his new van broke down. Since I’d bought another van because my job required 2 vehicles he asked to use the truck until he got his van fixed. I hadn’t even driven the truck one time after those repairs.. he took the truck to use it and never fixed the van. We broke up the 2nd and final time about a year later. He took the truck and here we are now present day. He’s had the truck for the 3 years since we separated . I paid the insurance on it for almost 2 years of the 3 we were not together because he never had the money for it. There’s far too much money into the vehicle to even sell it. Then He said he didn’t think he wanted to sell it now, instead he wanted to park it somewhere and have it for a back up vehicle. Still .. it is and would continue to be in my name if he did that. I am moving out of state in a few weeks. He plans to have his van registered in a few weeks. Am I the asshole at this point if I take the truck back ? He seems to feel as if it’s his. I don’t know if it’s because he’s driven it for so long or if he really thinks that 500 and a few oil changes makes him the owner ..."
legaladvice,Accept Settlement from Amazon or Sue?,"Hello all,

I'm writing this from Michigan, if it makes a difference.

Back around November 15th, we had a snowstorm in Michigan.  About a week later, an Amazon driver was coming down my long driveway way too fast (which pretty much describes every package delivery they make here) and slid off of the cement and into my grass and got stuck.  Instead of trying to get help, he basically tried going forward and back for about an hour and absolutely destroyed a large section of my lawn. In some areas, he dug down to the mud; in others, he put large, deep ruts. The overall affected area is roughly 30' long by 15' wide. All of the grass in this area isn't destroyed but based on the missing grass and ruts, I'm not sure how you'd fix it without removing this section and sodding or re-seeding.

Anyway, I made a claim with Amazon including sending in pictures and an estimate, for $1,500. It's taken them over 2 months to get back to me with a resolution, and today they said they were going to send a check for $300 to resolve the matter.

So, I think my options are to bite the bullet and accept their $300, or sue. If I sue, I'm guessing the best way is to go to small claims court but I have no idea how that works, what the likelihood of winning is or if it's even feasible due to the size &amp; location of Amazon. Thanks."
legaladvice,TEXAS - Fractional VP as 1099/C2C/W2,"Hello!

I’m currently a W2 Executive for a company A, and an old colleague called me up and told me their  company B is trying to enter a new sub market and needed someone with my experience to help. Before joining my current company, I worked in an entirely different industry, and built a great network and breadth of understanding. The company that is asking for my help is looking to leverage that in a very narrow scope and utilize me as someone who knows the new sub market very well. Their ask is that I hold a VP title but only work on their brand presence, and facilitating engagements for them. Wouldn’t go into the office unless it was for a specific purpose, maybe 5-15hrs a week max, billed hourly. 

The question is, can I be a 1099 IC holding a Fractional VP title if my scope of work is very narrowly defined? Since it’s just me, I don’t think I can do a C2C.

legaladvice,Divorce/Mortgage in Both Parties’ Name/Quitclaim Deed/One Party With Potential Lien?,"Will try to keep as this simple and clear as possible!

State of Ohio. Marriage ended in dissolution after 13 years - documents signed and all finalized in July 2019.

Single-family home was refinanced in 2016 and both of our names are on the mortgage. She moved out in September of 2018 and I continue to reside in the home. I have been making all payments (mortgage, taxes, insurance). As part of the judgment she signed a quitclaim deed and her attorney has it in his possession, the idea being that the home would be sold and she forfeited al interest in the gains or losses from the sale. However the home has yet to sell.

She has somehow gotten herself into a situation now where she has ownership of a semi truck (some kind of garbage with her brother and some scammy stuff - not sure on all the details) but cannot make the payments - she spoke with an attorney to try to sort it all out and he asked her if she “owned” anything. 

My question: is the fact that her name is on the mortgage something to be concerned about if a situation arises where someone tries to put a lien on the property? In other words am I going to be under the gun for stupid financial mistakes she makes going forward? Will “executing” the quitclaim deed provide any protection against this? Is there anything else I can do to protect myself? I’d rather not be forced out at this exact point in time.

legaladvice,"Fired from Management Job, Offered Union Position. HELP"," 

Throwaway for privacy reasons.

I work for a large Canadian corporation (+30k employees). I am located in Quebec.

I worked at the call center initially, for 1.5 years. This was a unionized position that barely paid minimum wage. I was also treated awfully.

I worked hard though and received a promotion to a position in management, which was much better (or so I thought).

Now, 5.5 months into my new position, I am being fired. According to my manager, my work was not where it was supposed to be, despite him continually using my work and putting his name on it (this is another issue. I did my work well but people were jealous and ran all over me).

I met with my boss and HR this week and was told I am being let go. But there is a position for me at the call center I can take and can start Monday.

I rejected this, as I realized from this new job I had way more potential than working at the call center, and I was not ready to be yelled at again. Plus the union for the call center is garbage, and the pay is less than half what I am getting now. And it would involve working overnights and weekends vs. 9am-5pm.

But my termination letter literally just states that I am being moved to the call center. It never says I'm being terminated.

I explained to my boss and HR that I will probably have a hard time getting Employment Insurance this way, since it looks like I'm quitting rather than being fired. I wanted this to be clear in a new drafted letter, but they claim they cannot hide the fact that they gave me another job in the letter.

Do I have the right to demand a letter simply stating I was fired from my job?

If I can't get a letter stating that, will this be a problem when applying for EI? I am concerned it looks like I am quitting since the only letter I have says I was offered another position in the company, which I rejected.

Aside from the fact that I believe I am being wrongfully terminated, I feel like this has become a case of disguised termination. They are trying to throw me into a horrible position, they know I won't take, in order to get me to quit so their EI premiums don't go up.

Perhaps I am wrong and over concerned for nothing, but any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated!"
legaladvice,Might lose my house in long winded story - need advice.,"Hello, I'm not sure if this post would fit here, or /r/financialadvice or both.

Let me just hop right in. Currently, I'm a 20 year old living with my disabled mother in NC. We've lived in the same house for 21+ years, she bought the house about a year before I was born. It's the only house I know, the only house I love and the only place I feel comfortable. 

Around 2015, my mother decided it would have been best to file for bankruptcy, so she did. because of this, the monthly house payment went up to about $1k and my grandmother moved in to pay for the house. She paid for it out of pocket every month. Unfortunately, she died a few days ago, and that leaves us without the ability to pay for the house, considering due to medical reasons for me (extremely bad IBS, most days I'm stuck to the toilet, you can see how that's not attractive to an employer), and with my mom on disability, we make very little per month. Immediately upon her death my mother and I discussed getting a room mate, until my boyfriend moves in.

Here's where things are cloudy and what I'm hoping I can get some clarity on.

My boyfriend is two years into college, and once he graduates he has a trust where he'll be receiving $5k per year. My boyfriend loves this house, and we want to buy it from my mom as soon as possible. The issue is, that's about 2 years out, and we need to have an answer to the house now.

My mother has talked to her financial lawyer and the lawyer says rooming up or selling are our only options, but I feel like there has to be a better way. Because even if we sell the house or not, my boyfriend and I WILL be back in 2 years to purchase it. It makes sense to me rather than spend all this money, moving back and forth on money we already dont have, it would just be the easier and straightforward option to get a room mate until my boyfriend moves in and not have to deal with the extra stuff selling and hoping I could repurchase it. 

I've also scheduled an appointment with my mother's lawyer so I can talk to her myself. She said the only issue she sees with the plan is that ""they don't like having relatives buy houses from people in bankruptcy because then they're getting an advantage from being bankrupt"", but that's not it at all. It's always been my plan since I was a kid to take over the house. Bankruptcy had nothing to do with that decision.

Basically my question here is, while I know this is a very specific issue and it will have to be handled with the lawyer, is there any advice you could bring that would, I guess, sway the housing gods that be, that we want nothing more than to pay for the house, it's just a temporary rough period. It'll still be paid for in the future, just right now it might be rough because we're looking for a room mate.

Anyways, thanks guys, looking forward to replies!

edit: for the record, I'm completely open to room mates. I say hell turn this place into a circus if it lets us keep it. My concern with that is if we have someone who misses a payment, or can't pay much we need to have some type of understanding with the debtors who we're paying for the house."
legaladvice,Potentially dangerous parking situation outside apartment,"North Carolina, USA.

I can provide a photo later if needed, but I'm at work right now.

Imagine a capital T where the base of the T is connected to a square. The square is the parking lot for my apartment and its neighbors (which are located around the perimeter of the box). To leave the parking lot, there is only one option: drive up the driveway/entrance that is the bottom stroke of the T, and then take a left or a right out, onto the top stroke of the T.

There are very often cars parked on the street that is the top stroke of the T. This is common where I live, and most streets immediately around the apartment are effectively one-way roads because of it (if you are driving and a car approaches from the other direction, the response is for one car to pull to the side in a spot where no cars are parked and wait for the other to proceed past). The parking spots are not designated by lines or anything; it's a normal road that people happen to park on. Whether this is technically illegal or not I cannot say and don't care; it's evident that the residents and police alike are fine with this arrangement (I have seen a car parked on the street get ticketed for being abandoned - the police cared about THAT but not the street parking of that car or any other). Normally this is fine for me too.

However recently there has been an SUV parked basically at the corner of where the two strokes of the T meet, on the right side. There is enough space to make a right turn, and the SUV is parked so that it does not block the exit or impede turns. However it DOES impede vision. I make right turns into the top stroke of the T to go to work, and I cannot see if there is oncoming traffic due to both the height of the SUV, the closeness to the corner of the T, and the existence of other street parked cars behind it (though mostly the SUV). 

Last week I pulled up to the intersection, stopped to look for traffic, waited several seconds to make sure there were no cars I could not see, and began to pull out. I almost T-boned an oncoming car that I was intentionally on the lookout for but didn't end up seeing.

The SUV has been there several days; I don't know if it's just been left there or parked in the same place, but it's still there. I've made the right turn out of this complex every day for a year and a half and never had to deal with a large car, parked too close, that is consistently present before. The past week of leaving my apartment has been nerve wracking.

Is there any law regarding how parking would affect line of sight and ability to make turns, and who should I contact if needed regarding what seems to be a pretty unsafe situation?

Thanks."
legaladvice,Company I never heard about trying to sue me.,"Hello, this would be my first post in r/legaladvice but I wont imagine this shall be the very last.

A few months ago while checking my bank account, I noticed something by pure chance, a charge on my account I honestly didn't recognize making. I looked for more information, and apparently it was towards some company called Gaia. I didn't know the name, and I tried googling it. nothing. nothing I would have done, anyway. After checking the time when the charge happened, I came to the conclusion I never made it, and someone must have gotten my information, and tried to steal some cash. I contacted the bank, they investigated it, and refunded the charge to me immediately.

After a small while there were a few more attempts made on my account, after which i got the bank to set me up a new one, and transfer the money over. No new attempts have been made on my new account so far.

NOW, heres the problem: recently I received a letter in the mail, from a company called GAIA ethnobotanical LLC DBA Mitragaia (thats what the mail says) BILLING me for not paying. I looked them up, and they sell this weird plant stuff.

Ive never bought from them. Ive never heard from them. I dont want to buy, or deal with them in any way, shape or form, but in the letter they are threating to sue me. can anyone tell me some options? (im sorry if the format seems off. like i said, first time here, i apologize.)"

For the past couple of weeks either late at night, 11pm-2am, or early in the morning, 5am-9am, my next door neighbours have woken me up screaming and arguing with each other, banging on walls, furniture, etc. Stomping around and throwing things and it’s getting to the point where I’m a bit worried for everyone’s safety within their apartment. 

I usually only ever see one person come out of the apartment and it’s an older man (maybe in his 40s), however I have on one occasion seen him walking down the hallway with a lady (looks a bit younger than him) and a child (maybe 4-6, I didn’t get a good look). But I haven’t seen the lady or the child in over a month. 

When the yelling starts i predominantly hear his voice and all the banging and such, then I faintly hear her trying to talk to him as well as a child crying sometimes. 

I’ve never had to call to report anything before so I guess I’m looking for some help because I don’t want to escalate the situation by calling the police but I’m cautious about going to check on them as well as I’m a smaller 21 year old female and well, hearing a man yell kinda makes me nervous.

legaladvice,Not Really Resisting Arrest,"Hi so I'm 19 and I go to UCSB which has a very small surrounding college town with way too many cops. Last Friday I was walking my friend home from a party at midnight he was drunk but was not posing a threat to me, himself, or anyone around. We were two houses down from his when one cop stepped forward out of a group of 5 or 6 cops, grabbed his arm and told my friend he looked a little drunk. As he pulled my friend into the massive group of cops I only heard genuine confusion from my friend no anger or resisting. I then stepped to a cop on the side and began asking questions, next thing I know my friends face is being slammed on the ground by the cops. I heard no arguing or fighting but the cops decided he was resisting arrest and took him to the county jail on counts of public intoxication and resisting arrest. They released him at 3:30 pm the next day. Once he was out he told us that rather than getting put in the drunk tank he was put in a cell all by himself, and was not given his phone call despite asking for it multiple times. My friend is also 19 and is very scared of the expensive ticket that I believe he wrongfully received. 

This whole situation seemed very fucked up and not right on the cops part, can someone provide any resources in the area or any tips on how to get the case dismissed or ticket cleared??? Any help is very appreciated and I can update with more info if needed, also if it wasnt clear this occurred in Isla Vista, California of santa Barbara county

Also WHY did they not allow him his phone call??? Is that ever allowed? Can that be brought up in court?"

legaladvice,former employer did not do taxes correctly and now I owe money,"edit:

RESOLVED

I'm still confused but switching companies mid-year and not knowing to add accrued income for the year rather than concurrent income is what seems to have happened. thanks, American education system! I know algebra though so that's great.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I was with a company for 3 months in 2018 and though I don't remember why I didn't include the company when I filed tax returns though I thought I did nonetheless, I got a letter stating taxes are owed due to what essentially amounts to the company only taking out half of the required taxes. I owed essentially 12 percent of what I made which makes great sense since that's the tax bracket but the company only took out approximately 6.45% for federal taxes and I can't for the life of me figure out how that would have happened. pretty sure it's been decades since the tax rate was 6%.

anyways, I know legally speaking ""I"" am responsible for paying those taxes but for the last year, interest has been charges on taxes I didn't know I owed. and the letter the IRS sent basically said in no specific terms that the full amount is owed by February 5th.(the letter is stamped January 6th but I didn't get the letter until the 22nd).

So I don't know what steps I should take, I know I likely can't do anything about my former employer being the ones who screwed up but am I really responsible for interest payments as well? do I call the IRS? what do I tell them?

I just don't know what to do since I can't afford to pay almost 600 bucks within two weeks."

legaladvice,will using my history of sexual assault for my Uni SAP Appeal get me in trouble?,"Hello! I was awarded financial aid for my first year of college so in order to keep that money, I was responsible for keeping my GPA above a 2.0. Not long after the semester started, I was sexually assaulted in a dorm room by someone who does attend the school but did not live at the dorms. I am planning on using my sexual assault as reasoning for subpar grades during my first year of college in order to get my financial aid back. I missed a lot of class (because I knew he'd be there) and that resulted in me falling behind. I did not feel safe at school at all. This was almost three years ago and I have since not gone to school after my freshman year. I want to enroll back in school but need to write an appeal to get my financial aid money back first. The issue is that if I tell them my story, I am afraid they are going to force me to tell them who it was. I really am not interested in doing that and would rather not give them their name. Legally, am I required to tell on this person if I disclose what they did to me in my SAP Appeal? In short, I need to bring this up to justify my poor GPA but do not want to launch an entire investigation on this person. Any advice is appreciated.

legaladvice,Can my neighbor come into my yard to attach a tarp to his side of the fence? (with photos),"**Location:** Florida

Hello! The back yard of the house I rent is fully fenced in with a wooden privacy fence. From what I can tell, the fences that are on either side are not my (landlord's) fence. Instead, they belong to my neighbors. The back fence, with a gate, is ours. 

My neighbor is a junk scrapper. He and his girlfriend are constantly banging on things at all hours, dismantling washing machines and who knows what else. They're also loud alcoholics who are always yelling at each other. They are the worst type of neighbor. 

They recently put up some type of structure, like a large tent, in their back yard. They put blue tarp over the top of the structure, and draped the blue tarp into my yard. At one point, they had tied rocks to ropes and used those to throw over the top of the structure to hold down the tarp. This resulted in several rocks with ropes tied around them to fall into our yard. 

They also must have all kinds of things screwed to their side of the fence, because there are countless screws sticking out several inches. I have two dogs, and one of them has scratched his face on one of the screws. I put corks over the ones that are within reach of the dogs, but it's still very annoying. 

I went out into the yard today to find that they have now installed pieces of wood on my side of the fence, to hold down the tarps. Meaning they must have come into my yard overnight. We have a gate that latches on the inside, but is sort of easy to jimmy because it's falling apart (and being replaced tomorrow). I went over to check out the gate and it was in even worse shape than it was the day before, with boards falling off and the handle hanging. 

So, he clearly went into my yard, right? I feel like this is just an incredible invasion of privacy. Who do I even call?

legaladvice,"Management group in NYC doing ""electrical upgrades"" on my apartment without full explanations or fair warning of the procedure.","Hi there!

I live in Brooklyn and have a question about the legality of an electrical repair currently happening in my apartment.

My management had been calling me for a few weeks trying to schedule an ""electrical upgrade"" in my apartment. They had been doing what they call ""electrical upgrades""  in the hallways for the last few months which has included cutting holes in the walls, having wires out (they don't seem live and seem to be properly covered with protective covering) and installing security cameras on every floor. When I finally got on the phone with them to schedule a day (they could only schedule on Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm), I asked what they would be doing and they could not fully inform me. The woman scheduling the appointment said she didn't really know but that they would be replacing the breaker box. All the electrical in my apartment has been working fine FYI, I've had no issues.

Nonetheless I let them know a day that worked for me and informed my boss that I would need to work from home that day. On the day that I scheduled for them to come (today) they showed up half and hour early, 8:30am, and let me know that they would be coming in, marking off the front hallway of my apartment with plastic, and working on the breaker box. When I asked for how long they did not want to give me an estimate but after pushing them they said maybe 5-6 hours. They did not inform me that my power would be shut off at all — not when they came to my apartment or when I called to make the appointment. But I suppose I could have assumed that would happen since they are working on the breaker box? Anyways, I also asked the maintenance men what they were actually doing and they continued to be vague. The most I've been able to gather is that they are changing the ""brand"" of my breaker box and feeding in a wire into it from the hallway, but not telling me why or what this does or how it may change my current living situation.

They then shut off my power (I'm on my laptop now, linked to my phone's cellular data) and can't give me an estimate for how long it will be out. They guessed a few hours. This is not helpful considering I'm working from home today to even accommodate these ""repairs."" I say repairs in quotes because I don't even know what they or doing or why! Everything in my apartment has been fine.

Anyways, my question is, is this in good practice? Do I have any rights when it comes to this type of situation, if it happens in the future? What is the legality of a management group coming in and making changes to my apartment that don't directly affect me, and without explaining fully what's going on?

Thanks so much for any and all advice.

legaladvice,Low credit tenant with guarantor - better to continue month-to-month or sign new lease? CA state,"My first post here so please let me know if I get anything wrong regarding rules. I did some initial research but am really looking for some confirmation as to my best option.

I rented out a home to a tenant with low credit on the premise that one of their fathers signed on as guarantor. The one year lease is almost up and I’d like to understand what my best options are for the tenant, who wishes to continue living there. I don’t plan on increasing rent. 

As far as I know, my options are:
1) let the least expire and continue month-to-month. Does the terms of the lease, including the rental amount and the father as guarantor continue?

2) sign a new 1 year lease, with or without the father continuing as guarantor (he expressed desire to stop being one). I don’t think I’d want that as we signed this tenant with poor credit due to having a guarantor and if the tenants are paying properly each month, I don’t see why the father had any issues staying on. If they’ve had to borrow money to pay rent (which has always been deposited into my account by the 5th/6th of each month) then having a guarantor protects me from them falling through someday.


If, in the future, I want to raise rent or ask them to move out for any reason, does the amount of time I need to give notice change between option 1 and 2? 

Do I have the right to request the father continue on as guarantor in either option?

Thanks in advance!"

legaladvice,UK Renting Legal advice desperately needed.," Hi everyone! London based here, need help badly.

So I've been renting this flat since August last year and have multiple existing issues.

\-  Limited hot water in kitchen. The hot tap literally, dribbles out  water, it barely forms a stream. And takes upwards of 5 minutes to  change temperature.

\- The Central  heating and boiler haven't worked, despite someone coming in and turning  everything onto constant. The plug for the boiler, is connectted to a  piece of wall that is completely loose, resting in the place it used to  be part of the wall.

\- The shower in the bathroom only has hot water.

When  we moved in, the kitch was covered and stunk of mould. We paid for  supplies and cleaned it ourselves, as well as repainted all of the walls  connected to the outside with mould resistant paint.

The  landlord today sent someone round with the wrong part to TRY to fix the  shower, when we were told we'd get a replacement. Refuses to fix the  hot water in the kitchen, because he may have to fix pipes or whatever  and We've been paying full rent this whole time. The initial inspection  carried out before we moved in overlooked all these issues, they didnt  even check the shower or boiler or taps so it asn't marked as working  either. Besides this, the bolt lock didn't work, the toilet flusher was  broken and we had to use a bucket etc.

It's  been a nightmare and I've had it, trouble is, I can't afford  a lawyer.  But I want to know if they are legally in the wrong so I have leverage  to make demands. I'm not confrontational and have had landlord screw me  over and take my deposit for BS I before so don't want to reuffle  feathers so any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I've had the same landlord for two school years, moving home in the summer. After my first tenancy we did not sign a second lease agreement. At the start of January (6th maybe?) I received a phone call being told I had to be out in a month and that I should expect an eviction letter soon. Earlier today, I received another phone call stating we had to leave our suite on February 1st. I never received a letter of eviction. 

I talked to my landlord today and he is saying he has a photo of him putting the letter in my mailbox and that he has money for lawyers and theres no way I want to have this fight with him. I'm sure he never gave me the letter though. I briefly read BCs tenancy laws and it seems as though he is forced to give us 2 months written notice. I'm pretty confident I'm in the right and I should not have to vacate but I also dont want to have a court process or anything seeing as I am in school.

I should mention we are being evicted because he sold the house and the new owners dont want tenants. 

If I cant find a place to go by the 1st of February what are my options? I always had a good relationship with him and I'd rather not compromise that. Is it worth fighting with him?

This happened in Portland, Oregon. I was driving up a major street in the inner lane closest to the middle lane. The other driver was in the middle lane what appeared to me that it was tried to enter my lane. I tried to dodge him and he swiped my driver’s side rear fender with his passenger side front fender. 

He believes that I hit him while he was just sitting in his lane and that I was going too fast. I know for sure I was just driving in my lane the entire time.

We pull over to a gas station to exchange information. I find out that the other driver did not own the car but it was his sister’s. Both the driver and the owner did not have car insurance. The other driver also only had an ID Card which is not a valid driver’s license. I told I’ll just let my insurance deal with this.

legaladvice,My mother-in-law wants to claim my daughter on ther taxes??,"So, to clarify, no, my daughter doesn't live with my mother-in-law and no, my mother-in-law does not have any rights over my daughter. 

My daughter has however spent a significant amount of time at my mother-in-law's house over the past year. It was by no means all year and may have been half, if I'm being generous, all at the request of my mother-in-law. She thinks she'll go from not getting any refund (she won't have to pay taxes back either) to getting $5,000 for claiming her when my husband and I are probably only getting between $1,500 and $2,500 per child. 

We have three kids, the other two have been at her house for almost the same amount of time as their sister. My questions are as follows:

What kind of trouble will I get into with the IRS if I allow her to claim my daughter? 

Does just staying at her house for roughly 1/4 of the year give my mother-in-law a valid reason to claim her?

Is she really going to get $5,000 if the only thing she's changing is claiming a minor?

 I don't want to start a feud but she seems pretty adamant that we allow this. They make more money than we do, we could really use the amount we'd get for claiming her and this just doesn't feel right.

Update: I just spoke to my mother-in-law briefly about what I had learned on this thread. We have agreed to talk about it at a later date as she was on her way to work. However, she doesn't seem like she is going to budge and still wants to claim my daughter. Here is her reasoning:

1) The amount she thinks she'll get has magically changed from 5k to 10k. Despite the huge jump she still never mentioned sharing the vastly imagined wealth. (Wouldn't have gone for it, it would've just been nice.)

2) ""Her friends"" told her that the rough total amount of time my child spent at her house (about three to four months on the generous side) is enough to warrant her claiming my child.

And 3) The various items (because she refused to take money) we have provided for the care of our child while in her home, the fact that she is not a guardian or parent, and that my child staying with her was on her request, have all flown the coop in her reasoning

I understand that the union helps workers and all but they take a decent chunk of money out of my check every week, and it’s only a part time, so the checks aren’t big to begin with. 

They do have union meetings where they’ll give you $100 (once a year) just for showing up, but the date they had posted on the board was wrong and I missed the meeting. If I get let go I won’t have a chance to go to the second meeting. I’m guessing this is the only real leverage I have.

One of the requirements, and as far as I know, the only medicinal requirement is to submit a medical certificate showing that the applicant has good enough vision to drive.

&amp;#x200B;

As every person in higher primary school in Finland gets a ""youth's medical certificate"" issued by a certified medical doctor, which is valid for 5 years, and specifically states the doctor recommends a driver's license permit being issued for A, B and C vehicle classes, the paper is more extensive than the vision control I would've had to do in Sweden but still has vision included, I submitted that paper to the authorities with my signature confirming the situation hasn't changed since the issuing of the document.

&amp;#x200B;

The Swedish transportation authority denied my application on basis of the certificate being older than two months, that is assigned as a time period in the Swedish traffic regulation as the maximum amount of time allowed to be since the issuing of the medical document. I appealed this decision to the administrative court and they denied it on the same basis. I'm just thinking there should be EU legislation on compatible medical documents as the certificate clearly states a validity period of five years.

So I'm turning to here if someone of you have experience on EU legislation or perhaps even Swedish law regarding this as I have about 1.5 weeks left before an appeal must be submitted and don't really know where to start searching.

As mentioned in the title, I have had significant amounts of food back up from my bathtub drain. This has occurred on three separate occasions in the last month. My lease says the following: 

* ""Tenant shall be responsible for plumbing stoppages.""

and 

* ""Tenant shall pay charges by drain cleaning company except when it is determined by drain cleaning company that a drain problem is beyond tenant control."" 

I called a local plumbing company to clear the clog. The plumber who came to fix the issue determined that my upstairs neighbors' kitchen drain line connects directly to my bathtub and sink drain line. The tech concluded that the issue could not have been caused by the occupants of my unit. I asked him to write that information on the receipt he made out, and he did so. I also asked him to call my landlord and inform them of the same information, which he also did. Finally, I emailed my landlord myself and informed them of what the plumber had said, and asked them for a reimbursement as the issue had been assessed as beyond my control. The handwriting of the tech was pretty bad, but what follows is the best I can interpret it. 

&gt; ""1/4 through tub overflow, Opened at 5-10. [illegible] ran 5 times. Thick grease buildup from 125 kitchen. 

Again, 125 is the address number of my upstairs neighbors. 

The landlord responded that the ""technician has never spoken to them before"" but told me that I was welcome to send them a photocopy of the reciept, and ""they could contact the plumbing company for clarification."" I did so on December 17th of 2019. My landlord did not contact me about this issue again until I prompted them to on December 30th. During that period, the drain backed up again, and my landlord paid for the cleaning. I do not have any electronic or written record of this, because the other occupant of my unit called my landlord rather than writing or emailing.

As said, I emailed my landlord again on December 30th and asked for an update. They said they had not investigated and would do so after the holiday. Again, I received no response. On January 16th, I contacted my landlord once again and asked for an update. They responded saying that the invoice from the plumbers ""did not specify the '125' portion of the bill. They added that they ""forwarded my copy onto the plumbing company's management since she did not received that portion and they may be talking with the technician."" (poor grammar, but whatever) The landlord concluded that at this point, ""they are unable to make any changes.""

Yesterday, January 22nd, my drain backed up more food than it ever had before. I took photos of the detritus; It can clearly be seen that there are pieces of spaghetti, large and fully intact pieces of herbs, grains of rice, and what appears to be part of the stem of a bunch of grapes. I took photographs of all of this. When using the bathroom sink, water backs up from the bathtub drain, along with the smell of sewer gas. Today, I called my landlord. They claimed that this was still my responsibility. I pointed out that the plumber indicated that I was not at fault, to which they responded that the technicians are ""not authorized to make judgments as to the source of issues,"" and claimed that the drain company's copy of the receipt (which was written on carbon paper) ""didn't say anything like that."" So, they were essentially insinuating that I'd forged my copy of the receipt. They told me to ""call the plumbing company and ask them to defer payment until we can figure something out.""

I'm just baffled and exhausted by constantly dealing with this. As per the lease, someone from a drain cleaning company identified that the drain problem was beyond my control. I don't understand how that isn't enough for them to acknowledge that the problem isn't caused by me. If they don't accept the testimony of the plumbers, then who else would possibly be able to determine whether the issue is beyond my control?

Of course, I've spoken to my upstairs neighbors and asked them to stop putting food down the drain, but they are consistently denying that they do that, and yet these backups keep happening. If this keeps happening at the same rate, and my landlord still refuses to pay for or refund the plumbing bills, I will be paying $250 a month for drain cleaning. That's 35% of what I pay for rent in each month. 

Because of this, I can't shower, bathe, or wash my hands in my own bathroom without filling the house with hydrogen sulfide gas and making more food erupt from my bathtub. And this is far from the only issue I've had with my landlord. My neighbors' kitchen line burst earlier this year, which made large quantities of water seep into my bathroom wall and basement, which caused a significant amount of mold growth that they have not addressed. I had to pester them for more than a month to even send a plumber out, rather than sending local handymen to patch the portions of the wall and ceiling that fell off from the water damage. There is a crack in the ceiling of one of the unit's bedrooms that drips water when it rains. They claimed to have fixed the root cause, but I won't know for sure until spring comes and rain starts to fall again, and the crack in the ceiling is still there. 

What can I do to make sure I don't have to deal with this anymore? I'm at the end of my rope, and I don't know how much more of this type of thing I can take.

EDIT: I should also note that *my unit's* kitchen drain line does not, at any point, connect to my bathroom line. From what I can tell, it connects directly into the main. And since none of the other fixtures in the property are being affected by this (if the main were backing up, basically all fixtures would be affected), it has to have come from upstairs.

EDIT 2: I'm also pretty sure that the receipt I forwarded to my landlord was made on transfer paper, so I'm not sure how the plumbing company's copy of the receipt could not contain the same information."

legaladvice,PayPal claims I owe them money and has sent debt collected after,"At the time of writing this I have not been contacted by the National Credit Recovery in person but I have received a letter.

Since then the issue has been resolved however it seems PayPal has decided I still owe them. The letter seems to make it clear that I can only contact them by phone, which I don't have. As well, the letter also states I have 7 days to pay them as of the date on the lettter. Oddly enough it arrived only today which is exactly 7 days after the date on the letter.

I needed a place she couldn't afford her place by herself. I was there a month and a half and she told gave me 30 days because she said she couldn't afford it. Not happy that I spent a bunch of money moving ALL of my stuff in (because she had nothing) and being in a rough spot financially I decided I was going to use that months money towards my new place I had to now find and for moving... Again and so quickly. I informed her of this and told her I would pay her in the following couple months. She was not happy. Fast Forward to mid month and I get arrested and don't get out until about 3 weeks later.

Upon my release I find out that my roommate contacted my mother with 24 hour notice said I have some of your sons stuff if you want to come get it. My mom sent my brother in law and he picked up a box of shoes and a hamper full of clothes. When I got back and contacted her to ask where all of my stuff was she said she threw it all away or tossed it. I had an attorney contact her about getting my computer back since thats my source of income as a graphic designer and she managed to come up with it only when I turned it on it was completely wiped and her name was on the lock screen. We met one more time as she claimed to have found my 85"" TV and Ipad and Iwatch. Accompanied by the police and her attorney and a restraint order.

I never threatened, harassed, or did anything that warranted being issued one. She stole (or Threw away) All of my property minus my computer and TV were talking Thousands of dollars worth of clothes, furniture, appliances everything I owned. Then gets a restraining order on me? Did I mention when I turned on my TV entire screen was cracked and is now worthless? And I can't say a word to her!!! How is this fair?

Alright, so I will start this off by saying that I am not really sure where to post this . 

Just that I need some help . Yes I understand that I am stupid for doing it and yes I understand that it was a bad idea but I am 19 and stupid so I guess it’s just me being irresponsible. 

So let me get started , about a the beginning of DecemberI quit my job because I hated working fast food and wanted to change my path.

 I had been livin in this place since May so 6 months. I started a snowplow job which sucked and I left that job after couple weeks because I got extremely ill. I live in MN. And me being stupid decided not to contact my apartment office . Without anyway of paying rent I lived until about now just getting eviction notices and court summons . I am moving back with my parents because I am ashamed of my financial stupidity and I have decided to go to school to try and make a better living for myself . 

I am pretty much all moved out and I still haven’t talked to them . My question is they said if I don’t contact them in 24 hours they will mark me as a “skip” . Ik that being marked for eviction is bad enough but does anyone know what being marked as “skip” mean ? I going to live with my parents and work for like 4-5 years from now on so I am not crazy worried about my eviction record but I don’t want to get arrested because of this place . 

So thanks for any help guys , I understand that I am stupid for doing this but I kinda had never lived by myself and I still am super embarrassed about me being not financially able to support myself . So that’s why I never talked to them"

legaladvice,Pharmacy dispensed the wrong prescription,"My friend is trying to get pregnant and has been going to a fertility clinic for help. Her doctor prescribed birth control with estrogen for the last month to prepare her for a surgery (hysteroscopy).  The estrogen was necessary in order to build up her uterine wall. When she had the procedure on Tuesday, the doctor cleared a lot of scar tissue but could not continue because her uterine wall was too thin and the tissue was too inflamed.  She left with a balloon in her uterus and a catheter that she needs to wear for a week. Now, she not only has to have this procedure again in one month, her timeline for conceiving has been extended.

Today, she received a call from her pharmacy and they told her that they dispensed the wrong birth control for her for the last month. Instead of filling the new prescription that her doctor ordered (the one with estrogen), they just auto filled the BC that she had taken before she was trying to get pregnant (one year ago).  The pharmacy did not fill the prescription ordered and her doctor was under the impression that she had been taking something to prepare her for a surgery when in reality she was not!

Does she have any justification for legal action here? She’s pissed and afraid this mistake could happen again to someone else with possibly deadly results. It’s a scary mistake and any advice at all would be appreciated!"

legaladvice,S/O is threatening to take me to court over my dogs.,"  Lately I've been considering splitting up with my S/O.

All vet records are in my name, and I keep all of those records. My S/O has paid for 80% of their vet visits, by his choice. But like I said, they're both in my name at the vet, and I am the one that always transports them to their appointments, etc. It was my decision to get these two dogs, and he was against it at first. I drove pretty far, alone, to get one of them. I'm very attached to these two, and love them so much. I can't imagine them being taken away from me for any reason.   
 So I guess my question is, how would the courts rule something like this out? Would I get them based on the fact my name is on all of their records? Thanks in advance.

legaladvice,I didn't meet the deadline so he backed out of contract?,"A year or two ago I signed a contract with an author. The deal was that I'd illustrate his work (I believe it was 138 drawings.) and he'd pay for them in stages depending on how much I'd completed and sent to him. I was extremely new to the commission life, and WAY undercharged him to the begin with. He also agreed to have my name in his book to give me credit for the drawings. Everything we said to each other was over message or email, so it's all documented.

I was given a prompt to illustrate, and I had to do it in a cute, funny, creative way. While the prompts were his, I know my drawings needed a lot more thought and creativity to pull it off. A lot of the prompts just didn't make sense, but I had to make it funny anyway. My drawings were the make or break in that book, without a doubt. Which is what makes this so frustrating.

Now where I messed up:

I was going through a lot at the time. Without going into details on the why, I'll just say that the effect was the most severe depression I've ever had. Think showering once a week, eating twice a day (if that), not leaving bed until far in the afternoon, and suicidal thoughts. I got about 2/3rd into the drawings before I couldn't do much of anything anymore. I essentially ghosted him for 6 months past the deadline he set for me. When he threatened me with lawsuit, the fear managed to kick my rear into working again. I bulldozed through the rest in a handful of days. (Though I feel that I should add that I didn't lose the quality.)

I told him that I didn't expect the last payment. I said that if I didn't stick to the contract, then I didn't expect him to.

I just remembered that whole thing recently, and looked it up to see what became of the book. It has 4 stars on Amazon, with a decent number of reviews.

And my name is nowhere to be found.

He made it seem as though he did it himself. Granted, it's not my best work. And simplified, though expressive, cartoons aren't exactly what I want to be known by. But I'd hoped it would lead people to searching for me online. Now I have nothing to show for 138 drawings but half of what I'd initially thought I'd be paid. What are my options?"

As you can see in this [image](http://imgur.com/a/TDcuMKt), it worked properly on the first one; I woke up at 7 AM on January 1 (E4) and slept at 9:30 PM on January 1 (F4) so it calculated that I was awake for 14 hours and 30 minutes (G4), which is correct. I used the formula =TEXT(F4-E4,""h:mm"") and it worked properly if the time that I added on cells F and E is on the same day. 

But on the second one, where I woke up and slept at different days, it doesn't work; I woke up at 5:00 AM on January 2 and slept at 2:00 AM on January 3. If it worked properly, it would have shown that I was awake for 21 hours. But since my formula was wrong, it resulted into an error in value. I did search google and experimented on my own for quite some time but as someone who just started using Excel, I'm not really good at it. It would be highly appreciated if someone can help me.

loop until original source data is sorted into the multi lines.

Then I plan to invert line 2, 4, 6, 8 and all evens so they flip such as 000-000-00111

excel,[VBA] Collection count smaller if item in loop is added after current item,"Hello,

There must definitely be something I'm missing or not fully understanding, but I've come across this weird issue while trying to write a function to generate some data for me.

I cannot post the entire function (since it contains private info), but this is the problem I have.

Just so it's easier to understand, these are the variables

Name | Typename
---|---
tcCol | **Collection**
tcItem(1,2,3) | **String**, part of the tcCol collection
regEx | Object - RegEx, with the **""\[.*?\]""** search pattern
tagLastColumn | **Long**
tagLastRow | **Long**
l, j, counter | **Long**


I have a collection (which already has some items), to which I'm adding more items in a loop. If I add the items to the end of the collection, the total collection size is almost 3 or 4 times bigger than if I was adding them after the current key.

    Debug.Print tcCol.Count
    
    For Each tcItem In tcCol
        If regEx.test(tcItem(2)) Then
            Set Matches = regEx.Execute(tcItem(2))
            For Each Match In Matches
                For j = 6 To tagLastColumn
                    If wksT.Cells(5, j) = Match And wksT.Cells(4, j) = vbNullString Then
                        For l = 6 To tagLastRow
                            If wksT.Cells(l, j).Value &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then
                                tcCol.Add Array(tcItem(0), tcItem(1), Replace(tcItem(2), wksT.Cells(5, j), wksT.Cells(l, j)))
                            End If

            Next
        End If
    Next
    
    Debug.Print tcCol.Count

This code returns **268 items before the for loop, and 2300 afterwards.**

However, if I do this, instead, the returned values are **268 items before the foor loop and 812 afterwards.**

    Debug.Print tcCol.Count

                        For l = 6 To tagLastRow
                            If wksT.Cells(l, j).Value &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then
                                tcCol.Add Array(tcItem(0), tcItem(1), Replace(tcItem(2), wksT.Cells(5, j), wksT.Cells(l, j))), , , counter
                                counter = counter + 1

            Next
        End If
    Next
    
    Debug.Print tcCol.Count    

I'm guessing that somehow, items added to the end of the collection are picked up as part of the for loop again and then replaced themselves, while those added at the current key do not, but I'm not totally sure.

Problem is that I need to add those items after the current key, not at the end of the collection.

Anyone got any idea of how to solve it?"

excel,"Random Question: To those of you who make excel spreadsheet projects for your job, do you put your name on them?","I just finished an excel project that will make people in a specific department work way more efficiently. My name is in the “Author” line, but I’m wondering if I should put it in the Spreadsheet as well

For example, the main visible sheet of the project reads: “Name of Project” at the top. I’m considering putting “Name of Project by My Name” instead. 

I’m wondering if this is too much or something. I don’t want to look pretentious, but I also don’t want others to get credit for all the work I put into it, as I have to send it to two different upper management people to approve it, then they distribute it to their lower managers, then it gets distributed to the lower managers teams. 

Have any of you made excel projects for people in your job and put your name right out in the open? Am I thinking about this too much? Should I just leave my name in the Author line?

Sorry for the random question, this is the first time one of my projects will actually be used department wide. 

Thank you!"
excel,Using excel to send bulk emails,"Hi everyone,

I have a spreadsheet of people I would like to contact. For a while I have been going through the sheet and just copying the person's address name into a blank email then taking my email template and filing in the email to make it specific to them. I figure there has to be a more effecient way to do this. Any ideas? Can I link excel to my email and have it write from there? Can I export each row as a contact? Does anyone have experience using Constant Contact for something like this?

Ideally I would like to find some way to send an email using a prewritten template but have the email be filled in with info from the sheet. For example I have name (Row A), job title (Row B), and job location (Row C) so I would like the email to read ""Hi (Info from Row A), I am reaching out to you because I see you work as a (info from Row B) at (info from Row C).""

Thoughts on how to do this?"

Here is simplified version of what I need with an example lower (Green) is what I need, (Red) is wrong.

excel,[Sheets] Using Sheets to Show Task Due Dates On Calendar,"Hello,

My issue is with creating a way to visualize due dates of tasks in Sheets via a calendar format. My new-ish (last 6mo) boss does NLT (No Later Than) dates rather than traditional gantt charting (of which I can easily do and have my own templates for in both Excel and Sheets if anyone wants them).

Below is what I created for our latest big project set. I intended to use a formula to check each cell of the calendar against the C5:C range and then, if true, assume the value of the cell 2 columns left (Column A) of the matched cell. I cannot figure out this formula to achieve this and I'm not super familiar with macros for Sheets.

My intended method is by no means the way I have to do it so I am open to any ideas for how to show this more effectively!

I'm a real estate agent and I need to figure out how to add a commission amount on excel, which for most deals is easy, just multiplying the sale by a certain percentage. However, for certain deals, I have a specific commission structure that changes based on the sale price, which is as follows.

For the first $250,000 of a sale price, the split is 50/50, for the next $250,000 the split is 60/40, and any amount above that is 70/30. Typical commission percentage from a sale is 2.5% of the sale price.

So, if I sell an $800,000 house, the first $250,000 of that is a 50/50 split, which comes out to $3,125. Then the next is 60/40 which is $3,750, and then the remaining $300,000 is calculated at 70/30 which is $5,250. Total is $12,125.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, Instead of creating 5 different Boolean variables for flag-checking purpose, i decided to get a little fancy and use one single string as a replacement to having those 5 variables.

Example below.

    Example 1:
    flag1 = false
    flag2 = false
    flag3 = false
    flag4 = false
    flag5 = false
    if True Then flag1 = True
    ' And repeat for other 4 flags...
    
    
    Example 2: What i want instead
    Dim smartFlag As String
    smartFlag = ""00000""
    If True Then smartFlag[0] = 1
    ' This above Example 2 won't work...

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to accomplish this? I saw Replace() function but i can't use this because of its required parameter for a character or sub-string to match against ""00000"".....

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I would like to keep this as a string ""00000"" format.

One other option i am trying to avoid is to convert the String variable to a Integer/Number variable and initially assigned it to 100000. Then afterward for each flag, it will just add 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1 respectively for each applicable flag

Other option is leaving it as a String but change the initial value to ""98765"" and for each applicable flag error, it updates the i-position string to 1 or 0. By leaving it to 98765, at least i can use Replace for identifying my intended index"

Criteria #2 - Descriptions of truck drivers in column R need to fall within a list of truck driver types
Criteria #3 - Dates in column H need to fall within a certain date range

Here's my formula:

=SUM(SUMIFS(Data!$J$5:$J$80000,Data!$X$5:$X$80000,{""82390"",""82391"",""82393"",""82394"",""82395"",""82396"",""82404"",""82405"",""82406""},Data!$R$5:$R$80000,{""Truck Driver A"",""Truck Driver B"",""Truck Driver C"",""Truck Driver D""},Data!$H$5:$H$80000,""&gt;=01-mar-2019"",Data!$H$5:$H$80000,""&lt;=31-mar-2019""))

excel,Formatting Macros running slower than expected,"Hello!

I put together a spreadsheet which is running much more slowly then I expected. Ill describe the spread sheet and include the formula's and macro's used below. Just as a side note, I am dipping my toes into VBA and most of the macro was written with the record macro tool. Any help is appreciated!:

&amp;#x200B;

The spreadsheet mainly consists of a Named Table (Table1) which takes in data (Columns A:J) and two columns of formula's (columns K:L). I extended the table with the two formulas down 300 rows to account for most of our data pull sizes.

Column K formula Looks for a dollar amount within a string in a cell:

    =IF(F2 = """","""",MID(F2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789"")),FIND(""."",F2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789""))) - MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789"")) +3))

&amp;#x200B;

Column J is an array formula searches a string (Sentence) within a cell with key words in a list (Named List) and returns any keyword it finds. The formula was returning 0 if it found nothing so I wrote an IF statement around it.

    =IF(IFERROR(INDEX(List,MATCH(FALSE,ISERROR(SEARCH(List,J2)),0)),"""") = 0,"""",IFERROR(INDEX(List,MATCH(FALSE,ISERROR(SEARCH(List,J2)),0)),""""))
    

I am unsure if there is a better way to implement these two formulas. Perhaps see if there is a way to write the second formula without it being an array? Maybe apply it only to Row 1 and have a macro paste it down to cover only the row size of the data as opposed to 300 rows? I am not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I have 2 macros assigned to buttons ""Format"" and ""Reset"". Format applies a distinct format while reset clears the pasted data (not the formulas).

Format Macro:

I wanted to add a custom sort but it made the macro take even longer to run through.

&amp;#x200B;

Reset: The formula I found to remove filters seems to really extend the duration of this macro. Its technically a for loop that unfilters every table in my worksheet even thought I only have the one table. I tried other formulas such as cells.ShowAllData but nothing else worked.

    Sub Reset()

I'm trying to automate a certain repetitive and manual task and I'm seeking some advice. I have to do this in approximately 100 CSV files.

1. The CSV files have a series of data, many of which is unwanted and requires deletion. The first item on the agenda is to delete all of the rows except for the ones with given keywords specified in Column A (in my case, there will be 2). For eg, if we have 100 rows, and in column A there are various record named called ""keyworda, keywordb, keywordc, keywordd, keyworde"". I want to specify and delete all rows which do not contain ""keyworda"" and ""keywordb"" in any of the rows under Column A.
2. Once Step 1 is done, the next item is to clean up unwanted Columns. For eg, delete Column C, Em H, I, K.

Does anyone know of any functions or macros which can help me automate the above to speed things up?

Thanks"

excel,RIGHT formula not pulling First name correctly?,"I have a sheet with a column that lists first and last names together. I asked a similar question last week but the requirements have changed and the formulas I found don't work like I thought they would.

For a variety of reason I'm not using Text to Columns for this template and want a formula to separate the two sides with comma. For the left side I have the formula below and it works perfectly.

    =LEFT(A2,FIND("","",A2)-1)

For the right side I use

    =RIGHT(A2,FIND("","",A2)+1)

This works sometimes, but other times it doesn't and I have no idea why. For example if I have John Smith, this works perfectly. But if I have Scott,Michael A then the first two letters get cut off. I'm assuming because of the space and Middle Initial. Despite having the formula only look for the "","" why would it be affected by this?"

    Sub StyleKiller()

        Dim a As Integer

When I try to delete them manually nothing happens, and if I try to apply the style I get an error saying “Style ‘name’ not found” so I assume they’re corrupted.

I’ve done some googling and a few forums have suggested changing the extension to .zip, deleting parts of the style.xml file, then converting back to an xlsx. Whilst this works it also removes all formatting from the spreadsheet. There are upwards of 50 sheets in each workbook so going through and reformatting them isn’t really an option.

\- Cat 5 (weakest fields on either Euro/PGA Tour, i.e. none of the OWGR top 50, predominantly ranked 200-500).

I'm working out shots gained against the field in each event, then adjusting the standard scratch in each event, dependent on the strength of each field. I'm wondering how heavily I should weight this. I know Josh Culp/Numberball do this very well for those aware.

For example; Adam Scott won the AUS PGA with a total SG against the field of **15.97, averaging 3.99** per round.

I've categorised this as a CAT 3 event, with a fairly weak field.

This adjusts the SG against field for all players (i.e adjusting the Standard Scratch).Adam Scott's changes to the following using this formula:

**Total : 11.11**

**Average: 2.87**

Examples of other categories would be:

MAJORS - N/A

**CAT 1 (RAW SG/1.006) - Total: 14.42, AV: 3.56**

**CAT 2  (RAW SG/1.011) - Total: 12.81, AV: 3.20**

**CAT 3  (RAW SG/1.017) - Total: 11.11, AV: 2.87**

**CAT 4 (RAW SG/1.022) - Total: 9.71, AV: 2.43**

\--

All players are adjusted accordingly using this structure. Has anyone done anything similar or have suggestions? Do you think this either weighted enough, or not enough? Would be good to collaborate on ideas."
excel,How can I track a changing cell value over time and plot the changes automatically to a chart?,"It sounds simple but I have tried to google this and all solutions always use static data as input. 

I have an excel file (lets call it file A) with only one sheet and on it only a single cell with data in it (a number in the cell). The most simple excel file you can have. One sheet, one cell with a value. But the value automatically changes over time dependent on another excel file (file B). Right now the number is 10. The number however is not static data but is populated by reading from another excel file (file B) by using a simple COUNT function. The number is how many rows in file B on a specific column contain data - are not empty. So the function in the cell of file A is the following:

=COUNT('[file B.xlsx]Sheet1'!F:F)

where ""Sheet1"" is the sheet in the file B that contains a couple of rows with data. 

Sometimes, the number of rows with data in file B changes, so the number in the cell in file A will sometimes be 10, sometimes 8, sometimes 12, and whatever else depending on how many rows in file B contain data at a particular point in time. That means the number in the file A will vary depending on how many rows have data in them in the column F in file B.

*This is what I want to do: track the changes of this cell and show it on a graph.* For example, the value in the cell in file A is now 10 because the F column in file B contains only 10 cells with data, the rest are empty. If I go into file B and either remove or add a row with data in column F, the number in file A will increase or decrease, and that change should be tracked and displayed on a graph where the y axis is the number and x is time set to update each second, minute, hour or day and the charts x axis is going on into the future.

In the end, if I go in to file B that has 10 rows and add 5 rows within a minute, a chart should be updated that displays that first the value in file A was 10 and then next minute the value was 15. This should plot a line graph so if after a day the cell value always increased, the line is constantly going up and each step on the x axis is a minute, an hour or a day.

Perhaps I am over thinking it and this is easier than I think, but when I google this I get either examples using static time and value data - ie two columns that have static months and values each months, for example. Or people say ""this is easily built in to excel"" or ""you have to do this completely crazy vba script"". I cant think its that hard tracking and displaying cell values changes over time. Its simply plotting a graph from a cell which has a value that changes. It doesnt even have to be a cell that reads from another file either, you might as well have a cell with a static number, and if you manually change that number, the line chart updates with a new value and over time shows what different values the cell had minutes, hours, days or even months ago.

TLDR: I want to plot the value changes of a cell to a line chart automatically as time passes. Something like ""plot cell data changes automatically to a chart every minute""

Any ideas how to achieve this? It feels like basic Excel yet after days I still can't figure out how to even start since I don't have static data as input."

excel,Is there a way to have formulas autofill to only visible cells?,"At my work, we have a couple of weekly reports made up of querys that bring up items from the time the items started being tracked, and then we filter for items from this past week. I do checks/audits on these reports, and I'm able to make shortcuts on them with =if statements, however, some of the statements will say something like =if(A1=B1,""!"",""-""), so when the filter is on for only the new items, row 1 and 2 might be visible. When we get down to row 5, 6 is hidden because it's not from this past week, so cell A5 needs to be compared to the next visible cell (we'll say A7).  
I've tried to work around this by clearing the filter for new items and adding to the formula to account for new items (like =if(and(A1=B1, F1=new),""!"",""-""), but that doesn't work because it still doesn't know to read onto the next visible row.

From here, I'd like to be able to create a function that alerts me as soon as 4 hours have passed. The reason being that items have certain buy limits every 4 hours. In B1696 for example, the 'Mazcab Ability Codex' can only be purchased 2 times every 4 hours.

I made a post last year similar to this and was told I can do this using VBA worksheet with the following code:

    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)     If Not Intersect(Target, Range(""A:A"")) Is Nothing Then         Dim time As Date         time = Target.Value         newTime = time + TimeValue(""00:00:05"")         Application.OnTime newTime, ""alert""     End If End Sub 

And this code inside a VBA module:

    Sub alert()     MsgBox ""4 hours that you bought an item"" End Sub
    
    I'll be honest. I have never used VBA before and was somewhat confused by this so any help would be appreciated.

excel,"Challenge - Create a list of values from 1 to 100, set multiples of 3 to display as Duck, set multiples of 5 to display as Goose and multiples of both 3 and 5 as DuckGoose."," After 3 hours of trying different things, including my very first attempt at any kind of macros, I had very little to show for my attempt at this challenge.

My initial approach was to select the 1-99 list and use conditional formatting rules to highlight first multiples of 3 in red, then multiples of 5 in blue, and then multiples of 15 (3x5) in orange.

A sample conditional formatting formula used to highlight multiples of 3 was =MOD(A1,$M$3)=0, which looked at the list and divided each by cell M3, in which I had entered the number 3. I used similar formulas for 5 and 15.

My plan was then to use the Find and Replace feature to find cells with red formatting and replace them with 'Duck', blue cells with 'Goose' and orange with 'DuckGoose'. However, AFAIK Excel cannot use conditional formatting as a recognised formatting type to perform Find and Replace. Dead End.

I then typed 'Duck', 'Goose' and 'DuckGoose' in three separate cells. Then cntrl+c on 'Duck', and cntrl+click on every (red) multiple of 3, cntrl+v, which pasted 'Duck' into these cells. Then the same for Goose on blue cells, and DuckGoose on orange cells, which took &lt; 1 minute.

excel,Using EXCEL to convert between different types of names,"I'm a Biologist (lower end of experience with excel - just learned to use VLOOKUP the other day) stuck on a bit of a naming problem. One of my datasets spat out 15,000 cells of data, but with a useless naming scheme for the proteins. It used a protein accession name, whereas I want a gene name.

Background, every gene has multiple names. For example BRCA2 is the gene name (causes breast cancer when mutated), whereas ENSG00000139618 is the respective accession number.

I'm trying to go from accession name to gene name because subsequent analysis is 100x easier.

I'm trying to figure out if Excel can help me with a solution. I used a database to convert the accession names to gene names, but it discarded repeat inquiries (so if I have 7 incidences of A0A024QZP7, it only gave back 1 CDK1 entry (corresponding gene name)).

Here's what I envisioned as a fix:

Column A - Original list of data with their accession name.

Column B - Function to assess a sample in A, check it in column C, then paste in corresponding gene name from Column D.

Column C - New list of accession names, no repeats

Column D - List of corresponding gene names to accession names (in correct order)

3 = Duck    
5 = Goose   
7 = Pigeon  

Then (selected values only)

3 = Duck    
5 = Goose    
7 = Pigeon    
15 = DuckGoose    
21 = DuckPigeon    
35 =  GoosePigeon     
105 = DuckGoosePigeon   


Is there a formula to return the correct text no matter how big the lookup table is?"
excel,"Conditional formatting a cell containing ""X/Y"" so it highlights the cell if X is equal or greater than Y","Hello,

As the title states, I need help with creating a conditional formatting rule so a cell containing ""X/Y"" will be highlighted if X is equal or greater than Y.

Here is an example table:

&amp;#x200B;

|Categories|Points|Points needed|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Category A|60/50|50|
|Category B|15/25|25|

&amp;#x200B;

In my Excel, I have multiple categories and I have summed them into the ""Points"" based on which category they are a part of using the =SUMIFS formula. If looking at Category A, I have Excel showing the ""/50"" part by adding &amp;""/""&amp;""50"" after the formula.

As this excel needs to be easy to read by just glancing at it, I want to be able to highlight a category if it has the points needed or exceeded it. So looking at the example table above, I want ""Category A"" and ""60/50"" to be highlighted as it has the required amount of points.

I hope there is some way of making a conditional formatting formula that makes it possible to leave the ""/50"" part in the excel so it is easy to read.

If you need more information, please ask.

Thank you."
excel,How to set Excel formatting in a .txt document for import into Excel?,"Made a .csv report, but the user doesn't know any formatting in Excel, so they want it pre-formatted. Red text for negative balances, yellow fill for low margin, left alpha justification, right numeric justification type things.


I can set the control characters and formating keywords up in the .txt generator along with the logic.


Data is on a piece of tech from 60s and sensitive, so not a lot of options outside the text document it creates.


If there is a link with the formatting legend and it's delimiting/escape format character I can figure out the text file.

excel,Web connection refresh issue,"I'm working on a dashboard that gets some data from a web source.  Refreshing the data worked fine until I added the functionality to establish the connection via macro.  Now when the refresh button is used, all of the data is just copied and appended to the right of the existing table e.g. Columns A through T persist but now U through AN have the same data repeated.  

Repeating the refresh does not append the data on AO through whatever it would be, so it's like the initial macro-led data download isn't registering as the data to be overwritten or something.  I cannot find any information online on why this may be occurring.  Refreshing again Here are some facts I think might be relevant:

I've tried with ""Enable background refresh"" enabled and disabled.
There is a worksheet_change event on the data page that does seem to be triggering frequently during the data refresh.  Though when I comment out this block, the issue persists.
I've tried with with ""Insert cells for new data, delete unused cells"" and ""Overwrite existing cells with new data, clear unused cells"" options enabled.

excel,Formula for predicting how much I'll make for the year,"I am a real estate agent.  I have a spreadsheet where I track all of my closings and income from real estate.  I use it not only to keep track of the all the info I need for my transactions, but also to track how much i make and for goal tracking.  As a salesperson, it is incredibly important to set goals and I use this spreadsheet to track my progress towards achieving those goals.

Currently, to estimate what my total income for the year will be,  I have a function that takes the currently amount of money I've made in the year and divides it by the amount of time it's taken to make that money.  For example, if the date is April 1st and I've made $10,000 so far; that's 1/4 of the way through the year and the spreadsheet estimates that I'll make $40,000 for the year.

Here's the problem: Most of my income is made in the summer.  I definitely don't have a straight line consistent income.  I can make very little money the first few months of the year.  Then, bam, spring hits and I make a lot.  This is where my predictive model veers of course, right after the spring market, I've made probably 80% of what I'm going to make for the year.  But my function thinks, ""Hey, he's kicking butt and there's still half the year left"".  My total income estimate skyrockets and then slowly comes down everyday back to reality as the end of the year approaches.

Below are three years worth of my monthly income.  Is there someway to use this data to make a formula or function that better predicts my total income for the year?

excel,Combining many similar files into a file with a template and all the data sets.,"Hi. First of all excuse my English. I don't always know how to correctly express myself.

At work I'm using excel (Office 365) to make documents for employees to track the quality of the manufacturing process (APQP - PPAP systems if you're familiar).  
This means that I have a separate excel file for every of the couple hundred products we make (and I need to change the format on pretty much all of them).  
In principal every document is the same. It has a fixed head with the product name/number and a table where workers enter their measurements. The tables are repeated depending on how many operations a particular product has. 

What I'm asking is how I could insert the operations for every product into a template which would automatically create as many tables as there are operations and also be able to set an arbitrary number of rows for the tables. Can this be done with macros? VBA? 

I'm currently using a different spreadsheet with the tooling info and a Word file with a template used for printing adressess on letters. This works but working with tables in Word gives me a headache. Another issue I can see is that for many products I need an image or a lot of text in the operation description which will probably screw with the formatting.

This is the form I'm currently using. The top half is the header which is only on the first page and below the product name is the table that gets repeated depending on the number of operations.
https://i.imgur.com/qE7WZmu.png

And if that wasn't enough I have more things to ask:

1. How can I keep record of the document revisions (version control)? I've seen a git extension for excel file diff but I have no way of testing it currently.

2. In the next few months we'll be trying an inventory system with Excel and Scan-IT to office app. Is a live excel file a good option for real time inventory tracking? Currently we have a proprietary solution that only tracks materials when a work order is printed but it can't account for the lost quantity due to operator error or damaged materials.

3. What literature/tutorials do you recommend me to check out if I'm mostly dealing with static data and table design? I don't think I need to learn any complex formulas or querry tools yet. 

Thanks for any and all help"

excel,Forcing INDEX / MATCH to return a blank instead of zero if matches to a blank?,"Minor annoyance that I have been having for years - I use INDEX / MATCH all the time to bounce specific logic against datasets by creating helper tables.  For instance, I have transactions for 1000 SKUs but I only want to review a specific list - I will create a helper table that contains a column with these SKUs (primary key) and a status ""INCLUDE"", then index/match to bring in the status into the main dataset and filter by the result in pivots, etc.

In almost all such cases, I wrap the index/match in an IFERROR to result in a blank if no match is found in MATCH.lookup\_array.  However, if a match is found in MATCH.lookup\_array AND INDEX.array results in a blank (example data: SKU, """" which would be the case for all SKUs that exist on the helper table without a status for whatever reason), the formula will return a zero instead.  I have been very inelegantly solving for this by wrapping the IFERROR ( INDEX / MATCH ) in an IF statement that looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    =IF
       (
        IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")=0
        ,""""
        ,IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")
    )

Clearly, this is a very clunky way to code in Excel as I am repeating the same formula twice, need to update twice, etc.  It works, but not ideal.  Anyone happen to know of a better way?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT - solution as per /u/CFAman:

    =TEXT(
    IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")

Twice a week I clear this data out and paste fresh data in. This takes something like half an hour if things go well - more if I paste in the wrong tab by accident. 

Much of this data will remain the same - a comparatively small portion of it actually needs to be updated - but I don't know how to single that portion out in Excel.

I've tried to automate this pasting in Python. This sometimes works, but pasting the dataset seems to be on the edge of what this computer can handle, and a 50% success rate is not good enough to script it.  Is there a faster way to do this (amenable to scripting or not)?

excel,Merging queries causes expanded columns to error.,"I have an issue where, after I merge two queries, a few columns that previously had contents all report error instead. 

Details:

Query pulls in a report (off salesforce), and then appends the exact same report for different years - these all have the exact same columns/data types, but for different years - so it starts at the report for 2018, then appends 2019, then 2020. 

Then, I expand two columns that contain [Record] data - the records contain an amount and currency, and I expand them into two columns, one for the amount, and one for the currency. So, [Record] -&gt; xxxxxx.xx, USD. Since there’s two columns with these record types, I get a total of four columns from expanding these two. 

Then: I merge (left, outer) another query that adds in additional text columns for each line, based on a column in each query - each item in the column selected in the original query matches an item in the column select in the query to be merged.

Here’s where the problem happens: this merge causes all four of the expanded columns (which again, were amount and currency, amount and currency), instead report error. 

What I’ve tried: I’ve tried expanding the two columns after the merge, but merging before expanding causes the [Record] to turn into text, and loses the option to expand because it’s just text that says [Record]. 

No idea why this is happening, since the merge shouldn’t (?) do anything to any of the columns except just add some columns to the right? Help, please!"

For a volunteer events, I have to create schedules for my teams. Pictured is the most recent one that I did manually. Doing this manually is like playing Sudoku, so I’d love to find a way to make this easier. However, I fear there’s way too many complex rules…? Here’s the run down on these:

* Every event usually starts and ends at a different time
* Every event usually has a different number of teams
* Every event usually has a different number of zones (anywhere from 2-6, typically)
* The letters are zones at the event, the numbers on the left are the team numbers
* Sometimes there are different numbers of teams allowed in a zone at a time
   * In this case, we generally wanted at least one team in A and at least two teams each in of the other lettered zones at a time
* Sometimes events have dinner breaks, sometimes they don’t
* Breaks can’t occur within the first hour or the last hour of the event
* The amount of teams who can be on a break at one time depends on how many teams there are
   * In this case, two teams could be on a break at a time, excluding the minutes of overlap for when they’re going/coming back
* Generally, we like teams to not stay in one zone for too long, and we want each team to experience as many zones as possible for fairness
* Sometimes we have a couple flex teams who go where we need them at the time or who roam anywhere except when covering breaks for other teams

excel,Hide pivot data fields with VBA,"Edit: Sorry for the mess in the post, trying to get it to display properly


I have a pivot table and would like certain value fields to be toggled on/off but I keep getting an error when I try to hide them - 1004 unable to set the orientation property of the pivotfield class.

This is the macro:

excel,Checkboxes to populate worksheet from templates,"Hello, my use case is similar to [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2ykalj/using_a_macro_to_insert_a_sheet_from_a_template/)

I want to have a series of check boxes on a main page, with numbers beside them that correspond to separate template files. 

When you click the check boxes, I want the contents of the separate template file to be added after the first page in the sequence they are checked, think long-form.

Then, when that template is no longer needed, un-checking the box removes the specific page, and its corresponding contents.

The intended purpose is room management, with specific details needing to be added for each room, but the room usage changes frequently, so that's why it's important for that data to be removed when unchecked.

The audience for this is pretty non-technical, which is why I need for it to work in this fashion, instead of just adding new sheets to the workbook. They will need to print it out daily, so if it isn't possible to remove the added pages, then a lot of paper could be potentially wasted.

Any help, or better ideas is much appreciated.

excel,What is the best VBA practice for sending out large amounts of emails by creating single file spreadsheets from multiple tabs within a single spreadsheet? Any other multi-store corporate analysts out there operating primarily in Excel?,"TL;DR I am trying to find a way in Excel VBA to use a named range of words to search for that exist in a certain spreadsheet's tabs names to export all tabs that contain that word to a single excel file. Example: In cells A1 I have my first search term ""NYC."" Spreadsheet tabs that contain this name exist in the excel file: NYC Sales by Type, NYC Sales by Individual, NYC AR Headhunt Status. I want to take all these tabs that have the word ""NYC"" in them, export to an excel file, and email it out all in one VBA step.


This VBA would result in the production of many files that contain several tabs each. One file for NYC, one file for LAX, etc., each of which has all the tabs that contain the original tab ""search"" term (in the example of the paragraph above, the search term is ""NYC""). 

The next step would be adding a named range of email addresses to send each specific file to in VBA: e.g. all of the NYC sales staff emails are placed into a named range which the VBA then references and opens up Outlook (or whatever the Windows default email app is) and possibly sets the subject of the email.


I've written some VBA and use some Excel Add-Ons like ASAP Utilities to automate the export of the individual location spreadsheets to individual files, but each of these solutions is imperfect and requires time-consuming manual steps each time (VBA code has hardcoded names of spreadsheets, which from time to time for different reasons change (e.g. ERP export of source data uses a slightly different report name)).


The business has a few dozen locations that all receive several reports weekly and monthly, laid out identically each with their own performance data. All of the excel reports are automated processes except for the process of emailing. Ideally, our ERP would do this out of the box but it's ancient and even the newer versions of it don't provide human-readable reports.

Any other analysts out there working for a multi-store business using just Excel? Any tips?"

excel,"Power Query: Manually add entries to table, without them being overwritten with the next refresh","Hi guys, 

sorry for the wall of text, I tried to explain as much as possible about the situation.

I create a monthly export from SAP which contains production related data, lets call it ""export.xlsx"".
I load the data from export.xlsx into a second file (""data.xlsx"") with Power Query and create one conditional column (""Comment needed?"") where I check whether the value in a previous column (""Runtime"") exceeds a certain value. 

Example for ""data.xlsx"", if the runtime value is &gt;10, a ""Yes"" will be added to the last column, else a ""No"" will be added.

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|
|002|Team 1|6|No|
|003|Team 2|5|No|
|004|Team 2|15|Yes|

If the value was exceeded, I need to get feedback from the responsible team in form of a comment.

Now I didn't want to have multiple people access data.xlsx, so I figured I could just create separate files for each team containing their comments (lets call them ""team1.xlsx"" and ""team2.xlsx"") and have ""data.xlsx"" pull the comments via a query.

So ""team1.xlsx"" would also contain a query pulling the data from ""data.xlsx"" relevant to Team 1 and add a conditional column called ""Comment"", where the comments should go.

Example ""team1.xlsx"", if the column ""Comment needed?"" contains a ""Yes"", then the new column ""Comment"" should contain the phrase ""Please insert comment here"":

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Please insert comment here|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|

Now someone from team1 can open ""team1.xlsx"" and put in a comment for order ID 001:

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Runtime 11 hours due to machine malfunction|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|

And I can pull those comments into ""data.xlsx"" via a query, works just fine.
The problem I have now is that this comment gets overwritten with ""Please insert comment here"" as soon as the query in ""team1.xlsx"" gets loaded again.

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Please insert comment here|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|


Any ideas how I can preserve the comments?

I guess I somehow need to have PQ check if there are comments which don't equal ""-"" or ""Please insert comment here"" and then preserve these. But no idea how.

I thought about adding the ""comment column"" manually to the table in ""team1.xlsx"" but then I run into problems if the sequence of order IDs somehow gets mixed up.

Thanks in advance!"

excel,Cycle between 5 font colors,"

Prior to me editing this (I found this on this subreddit) Color1 was set to (0, 0, 0) which was black. I changed that to white but I'm still getting black. So I don't necessarily have a problem, I'm more so wondering how thats happening?

    Dim Color1 As Long, Color2 As Long
    Dim Color3 As Long, Color4 As Long


    Color1 = RGB(255, 255, 255)

    Color3 = RGB(0, 255, 0)
    Color4 = RGB(0, 0, 255)

excel,Excel to look up contract based on date.,"Dear all, 

First of all thanks for reading this.

I'm working on a sheet that has a check-in date, personal number, contract number and another date (Date 2) were I'm referring to.

What I want:
I need a formula that returns the value (contract number) to the cell, where the check-in date was before date 2.

I have a sheet with all the data and another sheet with the Personal Number and Date 2. 

So explained:
If I have the date 10/03/2019, I need my formule to return the contract number that's checked in on 10/03 or a couple of days before that based on the 'Personal Number'

I'm assuming I can use the personal number for that, but I tried all match, indexs and everything but I can't get it to work.

Thanks in advance! KR Vince

If anyone makes a formula, let's say:
Personal number is cell A:A
Date 2 is cell B:B
Contract numbers are in C:C
Check-in date is D:D

If Date 2 (B:B) contains a value/date, Cell E should show the last contract based on the personal number (A:A)"

excel,Does anyone have a solution to add upcoming arrival of POs into an inventory planning workbook based on date?,"I manage inventory at an online retail company with 250+ SKUs and I am looking for a better solution for our inventory forecasting models. 

Currently, I have all the main relevant information on a dashboard-table with one SKU per row, and columns that are pulling data for current stock on hand, open purchase orders from our factory, open sales orders, average weighted sales, and months-worth of inventory based on these numbers. 

I also created a by-month forecasting section that automatically figures out, based on the current date, what the inventory will look like by-month for the next five months. This is done by taking current levels and assuming average monthly sales. 

The forecasting piece is missing a really important piece of information - PO arrivals. I have a table on a separate sheet that has all of our PO detailed information by SKU (ie: SKU, quantity ordered, expected date of arrival). Currently, I'm just doing a vlookup to pull any POs and adding it to my PO columns.

What I would like to figure out is how to reference that PO detail sheet, grab a PO by-SKU, and insert it into my forecast based on the anticipated arrival date. 

ie: If a PO for 1000 items of SKU# CKW-312 is arriving on March 12th, 2019, then I would like that to be added into the forecast model that month. See below.

There are 2 macros that I'm not sure how to write it out. For the first one will be a macro that highlights differences between the 2 tables. I don't think conditional formatting works. The second one will be a macro that adds in new data without affecting data that have been changed above. The reason why I am doing this is that I couldn't change any data that is inside the first table. Hence, I will need to create another table that features the changed data. Although, it might be good to just highlight the data manually whenever it changes, but I'm worried that the user that is changing might forget to highlight the changed data.

I'd like to find a way to merge them all into one big spreadsheet that has all students and all dates from one semester.

I'd just do the old copy paste, but I know this is going to run me into a lot of issues because of transient students.  So some of my sheets have overlapping names, some of them have names that are missing, and some have new names.  Is there any way I can merge these together, and anytime there's a new name (row), it just appends it to the document, and anytime there's a new date (column) it does the same thing, so I end up with one giant database?  Ideally I'd like to not have to do it by hand.  We're not a giant high-school, but there's still almost 1500 students on the sheet, and going through 18 weeks worth of docs will be a nightmare!

excel,Conditional Formatting: Fill rows that represent the 26th day of every month.,"My document has one row for each day (spanning several years). I have the date displayed in dd/mm/yyy format in column B. I am trying to set up a conditional formatting rule to fill all cells in the rows for which the date is the 26th of each month.   


I'm fairly competent with Excel, rules, conditional formatting, pivot tables etc. but I'm struggling with this one. The only way I can think to get around it would be to add an additional column using the DAY() function, and then CF when values in \*that\* column=26, but I would prefer not to add more columns/values to my document.  I'm sure there is a simpler way I could do this, just can't figure out what formula I need for my CF.

Say you have number 1,2,3,4,5,6, in cell A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6 respectively. in cell A7 we calculate the sum of A1:Ax. x is specified in cell B1 (in this case, x can be any number from 1 to 6). in cell A7, you can write the following formular:

CONCATENATE will give you the index of the cell Ax(if you put 3 in B1, CONCATENATE(""A"",B1)) gives A3).

Anyone know why this change was made?  Formulas still work and are written the same way but then Excel will insert an @ symbol and it's honestly just a bit annoying since I'm not sure the purpose and can't really find any documentation of it.

excel,Dynamic subtotals ranges,"I am trying to better my invoice sheet. I have 5 categories that all have different line-items to go with that category. I used to just have a lot of blank rows with drop down menus to select what line-item will be added. The rest of the row populates with what line-item was entered, and at the bottom of the category there was a sub-total cell that would calculate what was input. Then, at the very bottom of the sheet, it adds up all of the subtotals to one total.

I have recently slimmed down my sheet a lot by eliminating the extra rows under each category. Now each category has one row. Now, when you double click that row it creates a new one below it, copying all of the formulas in the line above.

With this added, my subtotal no longer works. So I would assume I need the subtotal range to be dynamic, but I have no idea how to tell it to do that. Because now, some categories may have 3 line-items, while others have 15, but I can't get the subtotal to follow that. Any help would be appreciated.

Here's a quick snippet of my invoice sheet:

excel,Creating a calendar with hyperlinks connected to another tab in the same file,"Hello,

I was wondering if there is a way to create a ‘smart’ calendar on excel as the first tab with hyperlinks to the activities laid out in the calendar, then when clicking on this you will be redirected to another tab in the same file... kind of like a view for ‘more details’

The purpose is to have my promotions laid out in calendar form (first tab) organized by the start and end date, and when you click on the hyperlink it’ll direct you to the second tab that consisted more detailed information about this promo. 

Thanks in advance smart people!"

excel,Big problem big challenge - pivot chart changes chart type upon slicer use,"Hey fellow sheet heads - got an urgent and big problem.

I have a data model set up - Calendar table (linked to headcount and spend), Headcount table, Spend table, and country reference table (linked to headcount and spend)

I've set up a pivot table with the date as teh rows, the Headcount measure and Spend measure in the values, and the country in the columns

The pivot chart based off this is a combo chart showing spend and headcount over time, split by country.

Easy peasy right, except when i change the slicer (country), the actual chart type reverts back to a bar from (from the combo chart)

One interesting this is that if i remove Country from the columns on the pivot table, then the chart type maintains formatting when using filters. Something about adding the country to the pivot table itself makes it revert to default formatting

I've looked online and seems to be an issue for a lot of people and there are a lot of weird methods to overcome this. I've tried a couple to no avail. Has anyone encountered this? Has anyone got a best solution to hand? there's so many variations of this same issue it's hard to identify the correct and simplest solution!

Edit\* to add this is only happening with the country slicer, the date slicer maintains formatting

2nd edit - seems like this is a big old problem, i really hope someone has a solution!!

excel,How do I create a dynamic link to the first empty cell in a non-numeric column?,"TL;DR: In search of a dynamic hyperlink to the first empty cell in a non-numeric column.

Hiya r/excel, hope you are doing well today.

I have been spending a good part of my trying to create a link in cell A5 that will take me to either the first empty cell in a non-numeric column (H) or the last entry in that column. The column consists of a repetition of five categories (such as admin and literature research) in a fairly random sequence. As its an ever-growing list, the last entry will keep on going down.

I have tried several formulae in Excel2013, but this one came the closest to functioning:

    =HYPERLINK(""[MyBook.xlsx]Sheet1!$H$""&amp;MATCH(CHAR(255);H:H;1)+1;""Last entry"")

With *closest to functioning*, I mean that it worked until I changed the first column identifier `$H$` from a `B` to an `H`. It stopped working, so I changed it back and then it all fell apart seemingly.

I have based my formula on one found on a [website](https://www.get-digital-help.com/quickly-jump-to-last-row-in-a-data-set-using-excel-hyperlink-function/), because I am one of those people fairly proficient in computers because they know how to use a search engine.

excel,Multiple Timeline Slicers Based On Multiple Date Tables?,"Hi r/excel,

First time poster here and I hope you can help (Office 365 Business). I have been trying to analyze a dataset and I have two different date columns I want to filter a chart by in pivot tables (Date Sold, Closed Date). I have a date table in power pivot with a relationship with Date Sold.

However, if I add in both Date Sold and Closed Date to a pivot table, and tie it to a timeline slicer using the date table that has a relationship with Date Sold, the Closed Date data doesn't show correctly. I think it is using the relationship to Date Sold as a filter as it shows the same values as date sold, but the correct values if i use a different pivot table without a timeline slicer, but matching manual date filter. [Pic Here](https://imgur.com/mekucPM)

I assume I cannot get around this, please tell me I am wrong.

As a work around I am trying to use two separate pivot tables, and make a chart using cell references using those two outputs. I created a second date table in power pivot and created a relationship between that and Date Closed. I am looking to make reports using these, so I am adding slicers for ease of use. 

Here is the problem: If I want a second timeline slicer using Date Closed, I cannot create one. Excel shows a loading icon and nothing appears, and there is nothing to undo. I can create date slicers, but that is a lot of manual clicking for what I am looking for, and i don't want repeat months, I need a timeline.

They don't want to use control+F or have to scroll through the data to see a highlighted row. 

I know this can be done in R with the DT package , but that coworker does not have R installed on their laptop, and I don't want to go through the trouble of having to host a shiny app to get this to work. 


Is this possible in excel? Should I use Access instead?

excel,Total beginner here. How can I use drop down menu that pull certain data (several variables) and calculates results on user input variables.,"Hi

Sorry this is rather difficult for me to describe  hence why I'm including an image.

* I work with around 10-20 nutritional products (main focus is on 3 variables; energy, protein and fibre)
* on most days I need to make up regimens from those products and this involves selecting a product to meet energy and then I need to work out total volume over number of hours (from this I get amount in ml/hour).

What I would like to create is document where

* I have a drop down selection of said products
* the drop down pulls the information (energy, protein, fibre)
* I input the amount of calories required and total volume total calories and total protein and fibre is calculated based on the selection from drop down menu.
* I input number of hours and it calculates the rate in ml/hr based on total volume

I suppose I could work with basic formulas here (as per screenshot) but I just want to know who to get the data to be pulled on selection from drop down menu.

I have typed the formulas and what data they pull from where. but like I have said i would like this to be ""automated"" by just drop down selection

PS&gt; the image does not have fibre but the calculation would be the same as per protein....

\- I've found Index Match can have issues if you don't remove the ""Sheet1!"" that occurs when you're moving between sheets to select the MATCH(lookup value.

\- Using Auto-Fill (double clicking the green box) to populate visible cells when your data is filtered may not work as intended.  You must you copy and paste to populate only and all filtered cells

\- You must make sure VLOOKUPs/Index Match lookup array have all unique values or you risk returning an incorrect value.

\- When adding a column to the right of a filtered data set, if you don't reapply the filter to include the new column, its data won't be attached to its intended row.

excel,Excel network links - network reference changing on its own,"Hi guys.

So I normally avoid too many links between workbooks, particularly in different network locations, but the company I’m working for at the moment *loves* them. As about 35 workbooks, literally thousands of links in each one. The kind of thing you really want a proper database or a BI suite for, but no one will pay for.

The problem is that these links have a bit of a habit of changing when you open the files.

For reference, the references are basically all:

V:\Site A\Admin\Finance\...

There are also a few links which read in the more traditional network way:

\\SiteDrive\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance\...

(For clarity, SiteDrive is the physical disk in the server at head office, Site1 is the folder which we have mapped as V:)

Either style of link works. The problem is that when you open some of the files, excel kind of hybridises the two reference styles, so I get:

V:\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance

So it’s inserting the folder from the second style into the first. There isn’t a Site1 folder on the V drive, so obviously the formula don’t evaluate.

I’ve never seen it do it before, it doesn’t do it in every workbooks (some it’s fine every time I open them), in the sheets that are affected, it doesn’t do it every time, and when it does, it doesn’t do it to every formula.

As things stand, I’m just doing a find and replace to correct it when I open the file, but I’m handing this process off to someone who had never opened excel 6 months ago and hasn’t got the strongest computer skills in general, so I’d rather not leave him needing to edit network links in basically any file he opens.

Anyone got any ideas about why it might be doing this or if these somewhere I can dig around to stop it happening?"
excel,Custom sort that ignores certain values,"Hello

I am the owner of a spreadsheet, in which i have create a list fra a data set using a simpel ""=data set cell"" and the filtering and sort that list.

My boss loves this list, and now want to add tags in that first column - but the kicker is that these shouldnt be sorted according to this value, but only by the date column. So far i have tried adding them to the bottom of my custom sort list, but this just means that the are still sorted above the others with the same date.

excel,Finding a way to automatically detect similar non-overlapping shipment trend,"Hi guys! 

Not exactly looking for a solution, but just thought I should ask in case anyone had encountered something similar.

My current project requires me to identify possible products that may have taken another.

e.g. SKU A might be taken over by SKU B due to a change in packaging size, but the total weight shipped should still follow the same trend as SKU A. so what I need to do is match SKU As to their respective SKU Bs, so that I can use the historical shipments of A to conduct forecasting. 

My current approach is largely to eyeball it. I have my data sorted by SKU code, with the monthly shipment across, like below:

|SKU|Dec 2019|Nov 2019|Oct 2019|Sep 2019|Aug 2019|Jul 2019|Jun 2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|00001-A|2250||1500|||||
|00002-B||||125|250||375|
|00003-C|||||2250|1500||
|00004-D||2250|1500||2250|750|750|

With the example above, I would link SKU A with SKU C, since C stopped shipping around the same time (and before) A starts, as well as at similar loads (1500-2500, B is much more different cause it's only in the hundreds).

With 40 months worth of data, and some blanks here and there, i was thinking  there should be a more efficient and accurate way to link potential SKUs up, or at least highlight them?

excel,Pulling transactions from sheet based on month and category,"So i have an excel sheet (actually google docs, but the same formulas would mostly apply) where I keep all my transaction history.

I then have a totals tab where i am able to see for each month the total in each category.

The issue i am now facing is this: Sometimes i'll look at a category of spending and it will be super high. Now in order to dig into where i spent the money i have to go back into my source sheet and manually go line by line and look at the categories and see what i spend. This is a bit cumbersome as i have 100's of transactions a month, plus scanning like this doesn't yield the kind of insights i'd like.

What i now want to do is create some kind of summary table where i can select the month or date range i want to check, and specify the category, and have it show me all transactions in the category, or by vendor etc.

How do i do that? As i mentioned, i have all this data in google sheets. if someone know how to do it directly in sheets that would be awesome, otherwise if you tell me the excel solution i can then see if sheets has something similar."

When i try to delimit them with spaces using conditional formatting so cells split into 2 (Spring | Lane""  and some split into more ""106 | Gates | Greece | Townline | Road""  I have tried changing the Format Cells to other types (Number, Text, General) and get the same result.

Basically what would I use to get excel to look from left to right until it finds the first alphabetical value and then split everything after that first letter. So my street and street suffix are still intact, but splits the house number and then everything after that into to columns.

excel,VBA grab data for each sheet in a for loop,"Hi,  

I've unsuccessful tried to get data from closed files dynamically, but I think I may have found a workaround using VBA. I just need help to get it working :)   

I'm building a worksheet that has to reference a bunch of other files, but I don't want to have to hard code them into my sheet (as that would mean having to update the sheet every time someone gets added/removed from the company). So far, I have managed to automatically import the name of all the files in the timesheet directory into some cells in the ""setup sheet""   

Every following sheet then grabs a name from that list and has it in A1. That means You have ""Setup Sheet"", then ""Sheet 2"" grabs the first file name on the list, then ""Sheet 3"" grabs the 2nd one and so on.

From there, all the ""Sheet X"" sheets have a dummy link. Think ""C:\\files\\\[dummy.xlsx\]Sheet1'!A1""  
I need VBA to go through every sheet past the first one, and then grab the content of A1 in that specific sheet, and then do a search and replace, searching for ""dummy"" and replacing by the content of A1.   

Is this possible? Would it then automatically link to all of my files, or will it pop the ""make a connection"" window even if given the full path?

Thank you."

excel,Having trouble summing multiple instances by part of a date,"For work I have to summarize the total number of items sorted per hour for various locations over a 6 month period. The data that I was provided with is all raw and an example of it is as follows:

[Column A                                     Column B                          Column C  ](https://preview.redd.it/0eicas12r7c41.png?width=393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=997bd7c1b30b6b75675c1da54ffeef83e5727926)

&amp;#x200B;

On the left is the date **Column A**, in the middle is the locations **Column B**, which are designated as starting with INTLCM and PFOD, so one location like BRANT will need to sum INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT, and on the right is the items flagged per hour for that location **Column C**. What I need to do is summarize all instances of data for a location on each day, ideally also omitting any numbers below 60.

To clarify, what I'm trying to do is write a formula that will tell me how many items BRANT processed an hour for each day. So I need to sum the total number in **Column C** that corresponds with INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT for a day (EG 2019-05-28), then divide that total by the number of instances of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT appeared on 2019-05-28.

So for example; if the total sum of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT on 2019-05-28 is 5000, and there are 5 instances of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT on 2019-05-28 in total, I need the formula to spit out ""1000"".

What I've used so far is

=ROUNDUP(IF(COUNTIFS(A2:A215,G3,B2:B215,E9),SUMIF(B2:B215,E9,C2:C215)+SUMIF(B2:B215,E37,C2:C215),"""")/(COUNTIFS(A2:A215,G3,B2:B215,E9)),0)

&amp;#x200B;

G3 is the date, written as 2019-05-28. Most data also includes time, so the dates appear as 2019-05-28 01:00:00, though I can delete the time manually. 

E9 is one part of the text I need to filter by, in this case INTLCM-BRANT

E37 is the other part of the text I need to filter by, in that case PFOD-BRANT

In reality the ranges need to be in A:A, B:B, and C:C form as the data extends down way farther than you could scroll. So far though I can't seem to manage to get it to ONLY filter by date, as when I write the formula was A:A, B:B, and C:C it just counts everything that a specific location like INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT did. I need to be able to do this for every day between 2019-05-28 and 2020-01-21.

&amp;#x200B;

excel,How to remove elements that do not fall within a specific range and calculate without them?,"I apologize if I'm bothering anyone here, just a question for a college class.

Essentially we have about 700 data points sorted into something like 145 columns as per the assignment requirement, we were required to find the mean and standard deviation for each of these columns. Easy enough, we all got to that point. We then had to find plus and minus four standard deviations from the mean, and we are supposed to remove the data points that do not fall within this range and recalculate the mean and standard deviation. We were able to find the range values we needed, but eliminating the values not within this range has proved to be a pain. No one can seem to come up with a good way to do this.

I've read on a few resources that you can use the AND function to define a range, but it only returns true or false. I also saw somewhere that COUNTIF could work, but I'm not sure how to plug that into a formula that would ultimately result in finding the average or the standard deviation.

We've all been thrown into this class with little to no Excel experience and this is the very first assignment we've been given. Please talk to us like we're 5. We could really, really use it.  Our professor isn't helping and this is quite possibly our last resort.

excel,"Comparing 2 sheet columns, returning third value only if matching","Excel 2010.

I'm trying to cut down busy work by allowing excel to compare a column on sheet 1 to one on sheet 2, and filling in a value from sheet 2 onto sheet 1. 

Example:

Sheet 1 has Columns A (Name), B (Sales), C (Credit Card Sales) and D (Credit Card Sales Percentage)

Sheet 2 has Columns A (Name) and B (Credit Card Sales)

Because of the way my company does reports, the sales report and the credit card sales report are two different reports and every day I need to turn it into one.

One difficulty is that there will always be some names that got 0 credit card sales, so their names will not populate on sheet 2.  This means I need a way to compare names, and return a 0 in Sheet 1 column C if there is no name match.  If there is a name match, then the credit card sales need to populate in S1 column C.  The two lists will not have the same number of names.

So sheet 1 could have 8 people, sheet 2 could have 5 people, but there needs to be an entry for each person in S1 column C.

I need to understand not only what to do but how it does it because if I can get this working I can use the same functions for other reports, saving several hours of tedium.

I am ok with excel basics but struggle with more advanced (or, likely to most here, intermediate) functions.

excel,Making a table/chart out of a column of data," 

Hi - I'd like to be able to highlight a column of dates (or any other data) and then create a table or chart from that data showing how much of each item is in that column.

For example with this column I'm posting below: I'd like the table to tell me there are 9 values of 1/21/2020, 10 values of 1/22/2020, and so on (the column goes down hundreds of cells). My friend told me I should use a pivot table, but I'm having a really hard time getting that to work.

excel,convert a word doc to excel by putting pieces in cells a certain way without copy and paste.,"**Problem:** I want to pool together these test items that I make as a teacher. I want to pool them in an excel file, but I am having trouble. They start out in a word document. All questions are constructed similarly in nature. I want to be able to convert the word document into an excel file. ***COPY AND PASTING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ITEMS I WANT TO IMPORT TO AN EXCEL DOCUMENT TO CREATE A DATABASE.***

**My attempt at solving the problem with no success:** I have tried to do it by converting the word file into a plain text file. Then, I tried to use to add a custom delimiter to it then open in excel, but it never opens the way I envision it too. The one way that would work is if I could use 2 delimiters were a 1 paragraph mark means to move into the next column and 2 paragraph marks in a row means move down 1 excel row (start of a question) --- I have no idea if this is possible or how to do it.

**What I want described more:** Below I have copied and pasted a dummy example. The letters in red are where I want the specific pieces from a word doc to import to in an excel file **(THE SPECIFIC CELLS).** Basically, I want each question to fill up 1 row and each part of a question moves over 1 column. When a new question starts I want it to start at a new row. So question 1 would fill row 1, question 2 would fill row 2, question 3 would fill row 3. The word documents are always structured the same way with 1 paragraph mark separate parts of the question and 2 paragraph marks separating questions. There will not be 2 questions, but more ***(total questions vary)...***

The paragraph markers in the image are because I had the paragraph function turned on.

But this services is done commercially and residentially, and for tax implications they need to be recorded separately; this is a third criteria.
My formula sums the indexed total date, based on the criteria of what month, commercial or residential, and what job it is; and multiplies it with the total price per service indexed with the same criteria the applies tax.

excel,"Returning earliest date found for a specific ID across multiple rows and ""highest"" ranked value for a specific ID","I want to use a formula which returns all the rows where a specific ID is found.

However, the issue is when I use a standard VLOOKUP is that where a given ID (column A) is located multiple times within different rows of the table, it only returns the values in the first row it is found in.

This is partially fine as I want all the ID's to just be displayed on a single row. But what I also want to achieve the following (use attached image as a guide):

1. Within the date column (column R) of my attached image, I want only the **earliest** date found across all rows for a specific ID to only be displayed.
2. In the ""IR Code"" column (column AA) I want to return the ""highest"" ranked value found across all the rows for a specific ID (ranking order is:  LOM, DAM2, DAM1, AOG, 41, 43, 52. For example if LOM is not found for a specific ID in any of the rows and DAM2 is found, then DAM2 is returned as it's the next highest rank.
3. I also only want to return all the values from columns B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L (columns E and F excluded).

Someone please help, is it best to use a VLOOKUP or is another function(s) best? I am willing to clarify anything :)

I do not believe what I seek is possible but I have the following issue:

In column A, rows 1, 2 and 3 I have names written in English.

In column B, respective rows I need the names in Cyrillic letters.

I need a formula which does something like the following:

1. Take the name in $A1 and start checking character by character
2. Input each character to $B1

I do not see how this is possible with a formula and secondly, I fear that there are two letters which form a single sound (which equals a single letter), e.g. ""Ch"" and ""ph""in Christopher equal one single letter in Cyrillic.

Any ideas are welcomed!

**Edit:**  onceinamelon request a few more examples, please find them below:

Jack, Ali and Bernard are inputs in A1, A2 and A3 respectively.

B1, B2 and B3 must contain respectively their pronunciations in Cyrillic: Джак, Али, Бернард.

The only way I see this to happen is to check character by character in the respective cell and match the English letter to the Cyrillic letter."

If its relevant, the files we are linking to are on a network. There doesn't seem to be any particular event that makes the hyerlinks break. I've heard that sometimes hyperlinks can break due to excel crashing, and the file being saved from the recovery, however I'd say that it happens to us even without this occurrence.

The supervisor enters each case onto the summary/supervisor sheet, assigns it a unique ID, and assigns it to a team member. That info then gets sent to their individual sheets, providing them with their caseload (this part I have covered).

Then, the team member has information that they need to enter about the case (status, comments, dates, etc.). I need THAT information to populate back onto the supervisor's sheet, based on the assigned unique ID. Basically I'm needing excel to search across multiple tabs/sheets to return the value of a particular cell, based on the unique ID.

After doing some research, it looks like I need to use Index/Match/Indirect to accomplish this, but I can't seem to get the formula right.

I have it figured out for one individual sheet: =(INDEX(AR!Q:Q,(MATCH(A2,AR!A:A,0))))

""AR"" is the team member's sheet
column Q is where the information I need returned is stored

I'm just not sure how to re-write this with the Indirect function.

excel,Using Named Cells in Excel Workbook to Audit All Those Excel Workbooks in PowerQuery,"**Each Workbook**

There is a very well structured, perfectly identical series of Excel workbooks that have named ranges and cells throughout... t\_XXXX for this table or v\_XXXX for that variable/cell.  When using Power Query, naturally, all of them are visible and viewable.

**Location**

They are stored on a hard-drive--nothing complicated.  Power Query for ""Get from Folder"" brings up the file information all in a table like it is supposed to including Source file name, extension, date created, Binaries, etc.  All like we'd expect.

**Trying to Do**

Power Query for a simple table that shows ANY of that file/source information--so, let's say File Name and File Path, just those two columns (which the others can be removed as a step easily, I have that) AND show in another column the value from one of those variables/cells.  Let's say there is a ""v\_version"" named range in there and it has the workbook version code in it.  Some of these workbooks might have code ""BXX"" in v\_version and some might have code ""CXX"".  Seeing File Name, Path, and (custom column) Version in one table.

In theory this would be best if I can show more than one of those variables/cells.  Say, v\_version in the third column and it's value from it's workbook; but v\_person in another column next to it.

**Tricky Issue I Had**

When trying to do it with ""expand binaries"" or whatever, I have to pick ONE object in the Excel workbook(S).  I pick v\_version and I just end up with a one column table of versions (no source, no extension, no path, no context)."

I know there are lots of online ways to do this, but I want to try to get it done in my own spreadsheet. This is an excerpt from the overall document with the essentials. I want to be able to input the current share price at the end of the day, with excel automatically generating a timestamp and calculating the change of $$ since investment. This works fine with the current spreadsheet, but I have to manually adjust the graph range every time I enter a new date. This is because excel treats the date columns that have the value """", as some sort of value, and the dates suddenly become \_\_/\_\_/00 even though that is not the entered date. (Date column format category is ""Date""). I figured out that if the date equals #N/A (when the share price column is empty) then you can select the whole date range and it will automatically populate the updates with the correct date. The problem is, I can't work out how to get the circular reference that generates the timestamp to equal #N/A when the date is empty, and then switch to the date that the share price was entered when I update the share price. I have tried making the chart ignore blank cells, but this also does not work. I want to visualise the amount I have made/earned and the correct date, any adjustments would be fantastic.

excel,VLOOKUP and return complete row but with certain conditions,"Hi, I am new to the forum and I need some help please :)

I have several rows where a specific Event ID (Column A) occurs multiple times. What I want to do is have all the key information on just 1 row without having the Event ID being displayed on multiple rows.

As shown in the attached screenshot, in column P, I have for removed the duplicates for each of the IDs and in cell Q2 I have used the formula **=VLOOKUP($P2,$A$2:$L$38,COLUMN(B1),FALSE)** and dragged across + down to populate/create an additional table which I will be working on. Based on the highlighted cell, only the Event ID which is being looked up within column P and the ""COLUMN"" lookup changes, e.g, **COLUMN(B1),** **COLUMN(C1),** **COLUMN(D1)**.

This additional table appears to partially return what I am looking for. However, I need a formula to return the following on a single row for a specific Event ID:

1. Based from the Date column (Column C) I want to return the **earliest** date shown of a specific ID within the additional table created on the right. For example Event ID 211680 has dates 01/10/2018, 02/10/2018 and 03/10/2018 across multiple rows. I just want 01/10/2018 to be returned as it's the earliest date. However, with my formula it is incorrectly returning the date 02/10/2018, as shown in my attached image (cell R5). What formula do I use to ensure it's looking for the **earlier date** for a specific Event ID?
2. From the IR Code column (Column L) I want to return the IR code for a specific Event ID in terms of ""priority"" being shown in the following order: LOM, DAM2, DAM1, AOG, 41, 43. So for example, if in any of the rows for a specific Event ID, ""LOM"" does not appear, then it looks to return ""DAM2"", if that does not appear in any of the rows for a specific Event ID and DAM1 does, then ""DAM1"" is returned, as it's the highest priority code being shown. As shown with Event ID, it is returning the IR Code ""41"" (cell AA5), however, I want it to return ""AOG"" as it's the highest priority code. It appears my formula is only returning the values found within the first row of a specific Event ID. What can I do to ensure it returns the highest possible IR code? (Tried to explain this as simple as possible!)
3. From the additional table I have created, the formula I have used returns all the columns, however, I only want to return specific columns. I want to return columns: B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L and M. I have tried just deleting the columns from the additional table created but then it ruins the whole table and returns incorrect values.

I would appreciate it if anyone could help me out please and I am willing to clarify anything that is unclear! :)

excel,Finding the difference between weekly data,"Each week we upload two files of contact data to a helpdesk software. One file has ~5,000 contacts and the other has ~10,000 for two separate companies. When these files are uploaded weekly, any contact data that has changed or any new contacts are loaded in. This means that a very large majority, probably 95%, is not new or changed data, however is still checked during the upload process. This process takes days based on the volume and the slowness of the helpdesk software used.

I've spent some time searching how to compare differences between Excel workbooks/sheets but still haven't been able to accomplish what I'm looking for. The contact data is quite simple in that there's only 5 columns (name, email, group, employee ID, org and phase). In order to drastically cut down the upload time, I'd like to know how I can find the changed/new data between each weekly sheet, so that I can remove everything else and only upload what's truly necessary.

Hoping that's enough information and looking forward to any feedback. I did try downloading and using ""Spreadsheet Compare"", but either I don't know how to use it properly or it doesn't work the way I need it to (if row data is re-ordered it counts that as ""new"" even if info hasn't changed)."

excel,Power Query removing duplicates problem,"Hello, I have spent 3 hours trying to make a dimension table for my power query. Essentially this is what I have, I have 2 queries right now. 1. Is a query pulling a list of serial numbers from a folder with csv reports that contain how many serial numbers are active by month for the last 2 years. Basically how many serial numbers were active each month for the last 2 years. This report, has thousands of serial numbers that are not my companies. 

My second query, is my list of total serial numbers company wide. This is also pulling from a folder with 2 years of month by month reports. This list is larger than query 1 because I am trying to compare how many serial numbers were “active” compared to how many serial numbers I have total in the company. I need this because report 1 has some serial numbers that are “on contract” and others that are not on contract. I want to be able to see how many of the serial numbers in the first report, were on contract, that specific month based on the second report. 

I’ve got both queries set up exactly how I like, however, I am struggling to create relationships between the total serial numbers query and the total active serial numbers. 

My first solution, was to make a dimension table. I did this by taking the total serial numbers report copying it, and then hitting “remove duplicates.” I thought this would make me a list of unique value, however it did not. Whenever I try to connect the dimension table serial number list with the two other queries  it gave me a columns must be unique error. I looked and looked and looked, and finally just loaded the query into excel and when I did conditional formatting on duplicate values sure enough there were 5 serial numbers that were duplicated. Weird? Why didn’t power query delete those? I went into the power query and started adding steps to play with the formatting like making them all text and making it all upper case, that got rid of 2 of the duplicates but there were still more. Why isn’t power query removing the duplicates completely in my dimension table???

I’m at a loss. I have no idea how to do this. I just need to know whether the machine in report 1 was in that specific months report 2. I may be approaching this completely wrong, but I really need help. I don’t want to waste any more time at work dealing with this lol. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.

excel,How can I export a cell adjacent to search results?,"Hi everyone, I've got a bit of a headscratcher. My situation is as follows:

* I've got a very large database in Excel that I'm trying to search through and compile a listing of both the description and the item identifier which are in separate but adjacent column.

* When for example I search for ""apple"" the native search function will tell me where to find all records/mentions of them and I can ctrl-a ctrl-c and copy. Great, that works fine.

* The problem is that the reference number (where to physically find the file) is in a column adjacent (Column B) to the description to where ""apple"" is being searched (Column C).

* To make the database functional I need both the results from the search (the Column C results) with the identifier (Column B) but I can't figure out a function that'll let me export them both.

I had a thought that perhaps I could export the cell references (say C1234) and then changing the cell reference to the other column and export that and marry them. (C1234 is changed to B1234 in the search.) But I can't figure out a way for excel to give me the actual reference of the cell - because, admittedly I'm a massive noob trying to remember highschool excel lessons from a decade ago.

I'm looking for a formula that combines two IF statements with a multiplication.

I've tried to google it but not sure i'm using the right key words!

excel,Sorting students into multiple sheets by class (recreate Google Query in Excel?),"I'm working with a summer camp whose director tracks camper registrations and class assignments in Excel. Her current solution is to copy and paste camper data from her 'all' tab into each individual class tab. If she has to make a change to a student's info, she has to do it separately in every sheet.

In Google Docs, I was able to create a Query that pulled camper data into a new sheet according to criteria from two columns (Grade and Class). For example, this formula pulled 3rd graders who will be part of Class 3a.

=query(All!A:J, ""where D = 'Grade 03' and F = 'a' "",1)

Getting the camp director to switch to Google Docs is a non-starter. Is there any way I can pull 10 columns of student data into separate sheets based on the data from the ""Grade"" and ""Class"" columns?"

Also create a new column with the diffrence of the values of each line of the two columns i replaced the dots and commas. 

Is there any way i can make like a rule preset to do all this stuff in one click? Like a template or so?

Heres what i make:


Delete columns b,c,d,g&amp;h

Hi Guys

   I would like some assistance with this problem please. I am a novice with VBA, so please try to keep it simple if you can.

I have a List box (ListboxSh) on sheet ""Home"", populated by a series of 'If' statements. (This part works fine.)

I then call a User form""PrintOptions"" which holds some check boxes and  3 cmd. buttons, Customers, Admin, and Site. command buttons are coded as below to choose selected sheets from the list box and send them either to 'Print Preview or straight to print.  (All this up to here works fine.)

This is the problem, each set of sheets is made up of the same sheets but  is formatted differently. i.e. set1 i may be Portrait, Fit to pages wide 1 and zoom 80. it may have columns A to E Hidden =False, Whereas the sheets in set 2, although being the same sheets may be Landscape,Fit to pages wide 1 and Zoom 100. I may also like to Unhide some colums and maybe add some other page setup items.

The code below is what I am doing to get the selected sheets from my list box to my print preview / print screen.

**My Question** is what code do I need to implement the page setup changes and where in the code do I insert the new code. Please bear in mind that I may need to go backwards and forwards between the three sets of sheets.

I realise that hide/unhide columns and the page setup can be carried out manually, but i want to do it all by coding.

I'm trying to graph a visual representation of the make-up of the marvel cinematic universe by how many minutes long each movie/show is.

As you can see, the problem is that the first 'colour' of each bar are all named iron man, and so on. what can i do for every movie to be named individually? i'm guessing it's either to do with the way i entered the data, since it recognises the second label row as an empty bar, or it's something i couldn't find in the settings.

i'm essentially trying to use each bar as an unrolled pie graph, but all along the same scale. bonus points if you know how to remove the legend and have the titles *on* the blocks of colour. thanks!"

excel,Solved!!! Slow Excel File Opening/Excel Hang &amp; Not Responding,"I thought I'd pass along a solution to a problem my GF was having working with a crucial excel file for work. When opening the file, progress was slow and Excel would hang on 100% for several minutes and would become unresponsive much of the time. After following all of the usual recommendations for file repair, Office reinstall, etc., etc., I searched various worksheets in the file and noticed that one must have had some sort of data in some ""far flung"" cell because the (sorry if this is the wrong terminology) ""slider box"" along the right side of the screen was very small and moved very slowly as one scrolled down the worksheet with the arrow keys. This in effect made the file size huge. Rather than find the offending cells, I simply copied the desired ones and pasted them into a new sheet, and then deleted the old sheet. BOOM, problem solved. File size dropped from 6,900 KB to 970KB and now loads, saves and generally operates properly.  


To tell the complete truth, the situation was even worse at first — she had duplicated the problematic sheet, so the file size was over 12,000KB. Once I deleted the duplicate sheet and saw the file size drop by almost half, I knew the culprit had to be in the sheet that was duplicated.  


I hope this helps someone who is searching for solutions to a slowly opening Excel file or application hang/crash on file opening. This was driving my GF nuts. May you also be an Excel hero to somebody as well (even yourself)!"

excel,"TEXTJOIN used as array formula returning #VALUE error when autofilled down (Mac, Excel 16.31)","I am trying to consolidate customer and sales info into one sheet. Currently, I have a customer sheet and a sales info sheet and a third consolidation sheet. 

In sales sheet my sales are ordered sequentially in column A from 1 and up. In column E of this sheet sometimes there's a serial number (depending on product). 

I cannot modify the sales or customer sheet, only reference and join them in a third sheet where I combine the customer data with the sales data (both are referenced using IF statement). The linkage between the customer and sales sheet is made by entering the sales number in the customer entry on the customer sheet. 

In this third sheet I have added a column to collect all sales with serials belonging to a customer concatenated into one cell:

=TEXTJOIN("" "",TRUE,IF(E3='Sales'!A:A,'Sales'!E:E,""""))
E3 is referring to the Sales ID for this customer, which will be looked for in Column A of sales sheet and return one or multiple values from Column E into this cell.  

As long as I submit this formula into one single cell with Control + Shift + Return it works fine, but when I autofill down to multiple customer rows the formula breaks and returns #VALUE error on most of the autofilled rows.

excel,Using Vlookup and If to find a tax rate,"Hello there,

I'm struggling and need some help. Specifically, I need to use IF and VLOOKUP to determine an exact tax rate -- not a percentage, but a dollar value. 

Say the taxable pay is $417.40. Using Vlookup (approximate value), I determine the tax rate is 25%. Thus, this person will be taxed $104.25.

Hey guys,

So I am working with an insanely huge file that is riddled with multiple Vlookups per tab and each tab contains over 100k lines, and there is around 12 tabs. The time to load and work in the file is taking forever. I have an i7 PC with 32gb ram and using 64 bit pc and excel, and it literally almost crashes just by trying to apply a simple filter. I tried to save it as a binary file and it has improved immensely. My next optimization is to replace the vlookup with the index match function. It uses less memory and works much faster.

Can someone please rewrite the below formula into an index match? I can't seem to get it to work after countless times. Hopefully I can use this example to build upon the rest of them. Thanks so much .

I've created an excel document that tabulates all of my school activity information by due date/time/type(exam/quiz/assignment) etc. I would like to create a series of buttons that will allow me to sort and view the data in very specific ways - I wish I could post a screenshot, but I guess I'll just try and explain. I'm having a few issues

What I want: I'd like to create several macro buttons for sorting 1.) All activities in chronological order;  2.) All exams/quizzes in chronological order displayed intermixed. 3.) All activities in chronological order by class type.

Proposed Strategy: Record a macro for a custom sort of desired types in desired orders then link to shape button.

Issues:

1.)~~For exam/quiz view displayed intermixed - right now when I do I custom sort by type then date, the Quizzes show up down the list from Exams A-Z. Perhaps I have to use some combination of filter and sort tied to the button - the problem is, filtering hides data, and I don't want to hide anything. I almost want ""Exam"" and ""Quiz"" to be viewed as the same thing - but only for this view, not for all activities sorted chronologically.~~

2). Some of the cells in my date column are text (""TBD"" and ""Revolving"") - sorting puts these fields at the bottom of the list, I'd like them to appear on top (when sorting from oldest to newest).

Any advice?

Thanks guys

Edit: Also if any new data is added, then I'm assuming my buttons break...is there anyway for the chosen sort field to extend past my data range, or otherwise update automatically? I don't want to have to recreate the macro every time something gets added.

Edit - Just gonna use some if statements in a hidden column that pool Exams/quizzes into an ""in-class assessment category"" and then sort on that; and then TBD/Revolving assigned a date from 1800s in hidden column using IF."

excel,"Asset weights in portfolio, minimizing variance, maximizing return. (Solver)","Good afternoon,

So I am calculating portfolio weights in a multi asset portfolio, trying to minimize portfolio variance (calculated through =mmult and covariance matrix)  in daily returns. Right now I am using Solver with the objective of minimizing variance and Rule that asset weights should add up to 1. As far as I understand, right now Solver is giving me the weights for assets that would give me the lowest overall variance and a given expected return at those weights. My question is, is it possible to adjust Solver or some other formula that would generate asset weights as to give me the best ratio of return/variance (not necessarily have the lowest possible variance, but the best risk/reward so to say). 

This is how the spreadsheet looks right now.

excel,How to assign two values to drop down item and export to a third cell?,"Hi,

I hope someone can help me. I'm trying to create a sheet for accounting and I want to do following

I have a reference sheet with the name of services to be purchased and two cells with the price without and with VAT, i.e.

A .................B.................C

1 Repair.....360............ =B1\*(1+B37) Sidenote B37 has a value of 25%

&amp;#x200B;

So C1 outputs 450 in this example

&amp;#x200B;

............A..........................................B

1....................................Customer

was hoping for some help with a work excel

Example (| is a column separator)

Order 1 | sub-cat1 | subcat-2 | subcat-3|  

&amp;nbsp;

The way you get sub-cats are that each category a customer purchases is linked to multiple subcats

&amp;nbsp;

example:

&amp;nbsp;

category 1 = sub-cat 1, sub-cat 2, subcat-3

category 2 = sub-cat 2, sub-cat 5

category 3 = sub-cat 6  

&amp;nbsp;

An order is inputted into the excel with order number and the categories

Example: 

Order 1 | Cat-2 | Cat-3

&amp;nbsp;

and I would like to transform that into  

&amp;nbsp;

Order 1 | subcat-2 | subcat-5 | subcat-6

&amp;nbsp;

I hope that helps explain it.


&amp;nbsp;

What I've tried to do so far and I'm able to do is to use vlookup and find the corresponding subcats which are related to the cats. What I can't do is to place the cats into individual columns. The reason is that each cat has a different amount of subcats - I find that I don't know how many columns a category needs in order to display all of its subcats.

Now my coworker has organized their columns differently, and now my formula would end up indexing ""QTY"" and the match array would capture ""Price"". This is obviously not the intent of how I set up the function.

My question: Is there a way (without coding) that I can Index(Match( by searching for the name of the column header rather than creating an absolute value such as $B:$B &amp; $C:$C.

At first I just tried to use a standard IF statement (=IF(TODAY()&lt;=F4,""In Progress"",""Completed""). However, I noticed that if there is no date in column F then it still returns ""Completed"". If there is no date in column F then I want it to just return a blank cell. 

So I expanded the formula into a nested IF statement that includes an ISBLANK function hoping that would solve the issue. However, it's still returning ""Completed"". Can you guys think of a better way to do this? Here is my formula: =IF(TODAY()&lt;=F16,""In Progress"",IF(TODAY()&gt;=F16,""Completed"",IF(ISBLANK(F16),"""")))

excel,"PowerPivot - Aggregate a value, but ignore some of the dimension columns","Hi all,

I have a dataset where I'm trying to calculate absolute deviation.

Let's say I have the following dimensions:
Level 1
Level 2

and columns to calculate:
Error
Absolute Error

If I calculate it including Level 1 and Level 2 into context, my absolute error is going to be higher than if I just calculate it using Level 1 in context.

How do I create a measure that allows me to calculate the Absolute Error, only incorporating Level 1, but keeping Level 2 for context?

If I just use Group By in PowerQuery, obviously I'll get the right result, but it drops the Level 2 column that I need to keep."

excel,Most efficient way to filter table to multiple criteria.,"(The title of my original post was terrible, and I couldn't figure out how to edit. Sorry.)

I have a table (general ledger) of thousands of rows. If I want to filter to a single account number, that's easy. Sometimes I want to filter to 4 or 5 account numbers, and it's frustrating to select the accounts I want from a table drop-down with hundreds of accounts. I've come up with a solution...

In A1 - A5 I can type 1 to 5 account numbers I care about.

The table runs from A6:L10505 (row 6 is headers). In a column I added to the end, I want a formula that will return ""FILTER"" if the GL Account Number for that row of the table matches **any** of the numbers I typed into A1:A5. Then I just filter the table on the Filter column and suddenly I'm only looking at the 2-5 account numbers I care about.

My two solutions so far are below. I'm wondering **which will take more processing power and slow my computer down the most**, AND if there is a **more elegant way** to quickly do this. I'm NOT interested in a pivot table (for reasons that aren't worth explaining here).

(The GL accounts are stored as text, so each is multiplied by 1 to match to the A1:A5 list.)

Solution 1:

=IF(OR(\[@Account\]\*1=$A$1,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$2,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$3,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$4,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$5),""FILTER"","""")

excel,Implicit intersection operator (@) breaks array functions,"I opened a spreadsheet today and found several array functions have been corrupted by an implicit intersection operator (@). There was a popup that tried to explain what the operator is intended for so it seem this is a new feature. However, the automatic and unwanted insertion of the @ operator removed the array function brackets and broke the array formula. I had to manually find and delete all of the automatically inserted @ and use the Ctrl+shift+enter entry method to obtain proper results. 

Has anyone else noticed this behavior? Is it a bug? This is going to be a huge problem for me if I have to update all array functions in every spreadsheet I open.

Edit: More details:

The formula was:

    {=PRODUCT(range + 1)\^(12/count(range)) - 1}

It was converted to:

    =PRODUCT(@range + 1)\^(12/count(range)) - 1

This returned a different value from the previous formula. This only occurred in a single workbook. I have not been able to replicate in any other workbooks that contain the same formula or other array formulas.

Interestingly, this formula and other ""array formulas"" which previously required Ctrl+Shift+Enter to work, now work when entered as a normal function. Here are some examples of formulas that previously required array function entry that now don't:

Sum absolute value of difference:

     {=SUM(ABS(range1-range2))}

I’m a contractor for a company that requires I fill out a time sheet for them, and I also need to fill one out for the company I was hired by. Two separate sheets I am converting into one.

For the contractor timesheet, there are 6 disciplines, and each discipline has FOUR 2-letter job codes (i.e. MP, MT, MD, and MS). I have one helper column that lists the first discipline, and the four job codes under that. Then the next discipline under that, followed by its four job codes.

I have cell C2 at the top where you select a discipline, and I would like whatever discipline you select to have it’s respective job codes populate in cells B4:B7.

What formula should I enter in cell B4 that would list the first job code, where when I drag it down to B7, it will not just replicate the first job code and will actually show all 4 job codes?

excel,Using V look up across multiple columns to find nth value,"So I am working in the green cell, which is B44. I want to write a formula that looks up the first occurrence of A44 (Argentina) in columns B &amp; D.

Once that is done, I would like to drag the formula side ways in order to find the 2nd occurrence result, 3rd occurrence result etc.

If it sounds too confusing then maybe it is explained better by saying what I want in the cells. So in cell B44 I would want the formula to look through columns B and D until it found the first occurrence of Argentina, which is D10. So then since it was found in column D then I would want it to return a value from J. The corresponding value in J10 is in this case -2.

Then in cell C44 I would like it to look for the 2nd occurrence of Argentina in columns B and D. This happens in D19. Thus I would like the result in J19 which is 3.

Then in cell C44 I would like it to look for the 3rd occurrence of Argentina in columns B and D. This happens in B26. Thus since it was found in B I would like the result to come from column I.

I have a peculiar issue. Our client wants us to show the value of a cell depending on the content in the text box, we have already shaped the text box to look at how the client likes and are having extreme difficultly getting the code to work. I keep on getting ""Object required"". I have researched a lot and haven't been able to find a code that works. Only works with Active X text boxes.

Here's the codes I have found below, but have been giving me issues:

This code is when I go straight to VBA and try to relate it to the textbox specifically:

PrivateSub Textbox1\_Change()

Select Case Textbox1.Value

Case ""A"":Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(255, 0, 0)

Case ""B"": Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(0, 255, 0)

Case ""C"": Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 255)

Case Else"" Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 0)

End Select

End Sub

This one gives me the object error.

This is the code where I go to the textbox and assign a macro to it:

Sub AutoShape3\_Click()

Private Sub AutoShape3\_change()

Select Case Autoshape3.Value

Case ""A"": AutoShape3.BackColor = RGB(255, 0, 0)

Case ""B"": AutoShape3.BackColor = RGB(0, 255, 0)

Case ""C"": Autoshape3.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 0)

End Select

End Sub

Is there a better code out there or am I out of luck? Unfortunately we cannot use the Active X for the code, because they want their textboxes to look a certain shape.

excel,How can I avoid reapplying the same filter to a table?,"Maybe there's a better way to do this overall. I work for a small company and I'm new to excel so I'm not sure of the best way to do this, but this is what I have. 

Ultimate goal is to get each department their own personnel costs on one sheet.

Table 1 on sheet 1 - Budget table. This includes our personnel costs for each employee. 

Table 2 on sheet 2 - Distribution table. Each employee has different distribution of which department their personnel costs are coming from, but they'll always total 100%. It pulls name from the first table so as I add rows to Table 1, they carry over and I add the new employee's distribution. 

Table 3 on sheet 3 - Administration department.  The list of employees who have some or all of their costs allocated to this department. I have formulas so that it pulls from the other tables * their distribution for this department. I then filtered the table so that it includes staff who's distribution is not 0%. 

This works great until I add a row to the first table or change the distribution so that another employee now has some % in administration or has their % removed. I have to reapply my filter to the table. 

I plan on having more sheets for each department to have their own personnel costs table. How can I do this so that I don't have to have the filters re-selected on each table every time adjustments are made to Tables 1 or 2?

=QUERY('External Tab'!$A$2:$AO$11,""SELECT ""&amp;SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,MATCH(""Account"" ,'External Tab'!$A$2:$AO$2,0),4),1,""""))

Ideally, I would be able to have the '11' value dynamically change, based on the number of rows that contain either 'Live' or 'Pending' in the rows. That way, when the query is pulled, it returns a specific number of rows. As it stands now, if the table it is referencing is longer than 11 rows it will not pull in all of the data. I can't put an arbitrarily large number in there to account for this, as the query will then start to pull in data further down the worksheet that I don't want to see.

In trying to troubleshoot this, I am able to get the number of rows by using 2 COUNTIF formulas together:

=COUNTIF('External Tab'!A:AO,""Live"")+COUNTIF('External Tab'!A:AO,""Pending"")

In the above example, it returns a value of '10'. Ideally, this would dynamically make the range in the query **$A$2:$A:10** (instead of the static 11 it currently has)

If I do it manually by doing ctrl+f -&gt; replace ""ABC"" with """" it works fine. Recording the exact same steps in a macro and then running the macro, it gives me the error ""Number saved as text"". And no number crunching happens as it doesn't read it as value's.

# Macro code:

        Sub Remove_ABC()
           Remove_ABC Macro
            Columns(""D:F"").Select
            Selection.Replace What:=""ABC"", Replacement:="""", LookAt:=xlPart, _
            SearchOrder:=xlByRows, MatchCase:=False, SearchFormat:=False, _
            ReplaceFormat:=False
        End Sub

I tried adding to the macro to change the cells to Numbers but that doesn't do anything.

What am I missing/doing wrong?

I am trying to design a form that starts with a drop down list. Then based on what item you select from the drop a form would pop up with spaces to fill in numbers to complete an equation.

excel,How to find a cell value in table where column amount and order varies?," Hey there, hope you're all well!

I've been busy with VLOOKUP, MATCH and INDEX for many hours by now, but unfortunately I can't figure out this one.

I got generated report from our system, and it's headers amount/ordering changes once in a while, so I can't hard-code any columns into the formula I want to create.

In this example the only cell to be changed is K8

What I'm trying to achieve here is that when I change K8 value to ""BNI"" then the formula will go through all rows in the table and then locating one row which have:

* IF cell value on column, WHICH have header ""initials"", matches to K8 cell value
* AND IF cell value, WHICH have header ""relationship"", matches to string ""spouse""
* THEN return cell value from column, WHICH have header ""last name""

So in this example:

* when K8 is ""WBU"" then K11 value should be ""Beesly""
* when K8 is ""BNI"" then K11 value should be ""Martin""

Now, in case I'm overthinking this too much, then easier way might work as well, so the formula would go through all the rows, and if any of the cells have both K8 value and string ""spouse"" then it should return cell value of a column WHICH have header ""last name""

I was working on an access database that has a lot of different information regarding the productive process of different items. There are a lot of aspects here that are important, but for this particular report we are needing to use only four of them. The most important, and the one that it's related to the rest, it's the ""operative unit"". I have them all listed on tbl\_oper\_un. This table is linked to three juction tables: tbl\_join\_opun\_cqa  (that connects to tbl\_cqa a table that list critical quality aspects), tbl\_join\_opun\_provar (that connects to tbl\_proc\_var, which is a table that list the variables of the process) and to tbl\_join\_opun\_aep (that is also connected to tbl\_aep that list the associated experimental plans to check the operative units).  
I have linked all this tables to Excel, on different sheets.  
Now, this is like making a recipe: Not every recipe has the same amount of steps, and a lot of steps (or operative units) could be repited an indefinitely amount of times.   
What I was trying to do is this:  
\- Create a button that adds the amount of rows related to the amount of steps needed to complete te ""recipe"", that needs to have the same format.  
\- Select from a list the ""operative unit"" related to the step order of the recipe. Then all the others aspects would be linked to the ""operative unit"" and appear in the adjacent columns.  
\-Merge all the identical results from the distinct tables, so it's more organized and easy to view.

If a person answered the odd number question with yes then they have to answer the even number question that followed it, which asked about the degree of difficulty. Answers to even number question were mild difficulty (coded as 1), moderate difficulty (coded as 2), severe difficulty (coded as 3), or unable to do the task (coded as 4).

each of the 7 question groups (that's what I will call an odd number question and the even number question that follows it) has a value of 4 (I'll try to explain). So if a person has no difficulty doing the task (i.e. answered the odd number question with no) they get 4 points. if they answer with yes then the score depends on their answer for the following even number question (mild=3, moderate=2,severe=1,unable to do it=0) (please bare in mind that these value are kind of the opposite of how the answers were coded). Ok so if one respondent answered all odd number questions with no they will get 4 points for each of the 7 question groups. I want that to be divided by the number of questioned he answered (in this case he answered all question groups so 4\*7=28, 28/7=4. So this respondents final score will be 4 (this means he has no difficulty at all performing any task). However, if this respondent found one question group not applicable (empty cell) and answered all the rest with no then I want to calculate the average for only the question groups he answered (6 in this case). I want the formula to recognize not to calculate empty odd number cells at all.

excel,copy &amp; paste values using a VB code / Macro,"Hi guys,

i'm looking for a VB code that can simply copy the value from specific cell (B2) to the cell i am currently on...    thank you ! :)

the point is to have the macro in a keyboard shortcut to avoid the normal copy + paste values"
excel,How to Increase all Values in a Column by a Fixed Amount?,"I have a column of a few sequential hundred values (ranks for an index) and realized a duplicate 133, which means that everything below it is off by 1 (i.e. imagine 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...). How can I increase the duplicate 133 and everything below it by 1 to make it correct?"
excel,Excel displaying extra black window in task view,When I open excel it open a single windows but when I press Win+tab then I see two excel windows on e is normal another is black excel window; if I close either of those excel closes. I tried disabling all addins that I have still no luck.
excel,I want to look for a specific word in a table and use all instances of that word to VLOOKUP another word within that original set of words and then count how many times that second word occurs. Is this possible?,"I am tasked with displaying the daily change in “Issues” from Bim 360 Field. Bim 360 doesn’t show how many issues have been closed each day. As this is construction based I want to show this change per trade per building area. I would like to be able to upload the data Bim puts out (in the form of a table) and have it populate results automatically. 

I am attempting to use VLOOKUP within a VLOOKUP within a COUNTIF to do this. I was also wondering if I could use an if statement to do this. 


See the link below for a dumbed down version of what I’m trying to do. The orange tables represent the information I am given from BIM 360. The blue table represents how I want to summarize it. I want to count the number of total issues in the total column and I want to count the number of issues for each trade (sheetmetal or piping) in each area (Area A-E). Then I want to find the delta of the counter issues in each area by each trade.
