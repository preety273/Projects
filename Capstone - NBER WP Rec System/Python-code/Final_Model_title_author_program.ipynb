    "The three recommender systems are making recommendations for working papers using title as an input. The users can search by titles and find other most similar working papers to the searched query. Whether the text is vectorized using count vectorizer or tf-idf vectorizer, the recommendations about the working papers are not significantly different (especially in the case of recommender system for a) title and author, and b) title, author and program). The recommender system is useful to academicians, students and others who are researching on any topic in the field of economics. Also, it could be employed as an e-library for searching working papers similar to the working paper of interest. The system is built to streamline search of relevant literature in plethora of information available on the website of NBER. \n",

    "One of the limitations of the model is that it is based only on the text of the titles of the working papers and no information about user preferences for programs, authors is included. The results of the model could be improved if more information about user profile is collected and modelled into the recommender system. Also, the recommender system can be extended to other fields such as science and social sciences. "
