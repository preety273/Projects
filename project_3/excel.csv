Anyways, I encountered problems while I was trying to calculate the hours that I'm awake on a certain day based on the time I woke up and the time I slept.

As you can see in this [image](http://imgur.com/a/TDcuMKt), it worked properly on the first one; I woke up at 7 AM on January 1 (E4) and slept at 9:30 PM on January 1 (F4) so it calculated that I was awake for 14 hours and 30 minutes (G4), which is correct. I used the formula =TEXT(F4-E4,""h:mm"") and it worked properly if the time that I added on cells F and E is on the same day. 

But on the second one, where I woke up and slept at different days, it doesn't work; I woke up at 5:00 AM on January 2 and slept at 2:00 AM on January 3. If it worked properly, it would have shown that I was awake for 21 hours. But since my formula was wrong, it resulted into an error in value. I did search google and experimented on my own for quite some time but as someone who just started using Excel, I'm not really good at it. It would be highly appreciated if someone can help me.

excel,What do you consider basic data analysis in Excel?,"I'm running a short (10 week) training/education course in Excel/data analysis for half a dozen work colleagues. They are all professionals (managers or officers). Because of their different knowledge and skills, I had to start at the beginning and covered Excel basics. We've now looked at the UI, functions and formulas (including index/match), conditional formatting, simple stats, charts, tables and pivot tables. I now plan to move onto basic data analysis.

What would you consider to be basic data analysis? I appreciate that pivot tables are good for data analysis but what else? I plan to show them simple dashboards, forecasting and basic Power Query. They're not able to do anything too advanced. Is there anything else I should consider?"

excel,Faster way to format borders?,"Hi,
I have a timeline that is seperated into boxes. I want to format each box with a solid line on the outside, and dotted lines on the inside.  
The 24 boxes above the blue line are formatted that way, the 36 boxes below the blue line not.  
In order to format the 36 boxes I would select each box individually and set the borders.  
This doesn't seem to be fast, is there a quicker way to do this?  
I can't copy the formatting from the above boxes because they have different dimensions and some pre-filled content.

excel,Finding Sum Based Off of Variable,"So I'm pretty new at using formulas with Excel so I apologize if this is a fairly simple question to ask. I tried to research the sum function using other variables but have been unsuccessful in finding a solution. My issue is I have a spreadsheet where I am keeping track of items I need to order online, where I've ordered them, costs etc. On the next page to the right I have three sections for keeping running totals of Cost, Tax, Shipping Cost and Overall Total of the three. I have one section that is for everything on the sheet ordered or not ordered (that was easy to formula). The issue I am running into is I have a section for Ordered and Not Ordered where I would like to keep the same type of running totals. There is a field for each entry where it says ORDERED: and has either a Y or N as the value depending on whether I have ordered the item already. How to I create a formula that adds up the Cost, Shipping, Tax, and Total Cost but only if the ordered field is Y, or similarly N. So I can keep running totals based off of what has been ordered and what has not. I have included an image of the spreadsheet its probably easier to determine my question with it. I appreciate any help / advice, thanks.

excel,"Random Question: To those of you who make excel spreadsheet projects for your job, do you put your name on them?","I just finished an excel project that will make people in a specific department work way more efficiently. My name is in the “Author” line, but I’m wondering if I should put it in the Spreadsheet as well

For example, the main visible sheet of the project reads: “Name of Project” at the top. I’m considering putting “Name of Project by My Name” instead. 

I’m wondering if this is too much or something. I don’t want to look pretentious, but I also don’t want others to get credit for all the work I put into it, as I have to send it to two different upper management people to approve it, then they distribute it to their lower managers, then it gets distributed to the lower managers teams. 

Have any of you made excel projects for people in your job and put your name right out in the open? Am I thinking about this too much? Should I just leave my name in the Author line?

Sorry for the random question, this is the first time one of my projects will actually be used department wide.

excel,Using excel to send bulk emails,"Hi everyone,

I have a spreadsheet of people I would like to contact. For a while I have been going through the sheet and just copying the person's address name into a blank email then taking my email template and filing in the email to make it specific to them. I figure there has to be a more effecient way to do this. Any ideas? Can I link excel to my email and have it write from there? Can I export each row as a contact? Does anyone have experience using Constant Contact for something like this?

Ideally I would like to find some way to send an email using a prewritten template but have the email be filled in with info from the sheet. For example I have name (Row A), job title (Row B), and job location (Row C) so I would like the email to read ""Hi (Info from Row A), I am reaching out to you because I see you work as a (info from Row B) at (info from Row C).""

excel,[Sheets] Using Sheets to Show Task Due Dates On Calendar,"Hello,

My issue is with creating a way to visualize due dates of tasks in Sheets via a calendar format. My new-ish (last 6mo) boss does NLT (No Later Than) dates rather than traditional gantt charting (of which I can easily do and have my own templates for in both Excel and Sheets if anyone wants them).

Below is what I created for our latest big project set. I intended to use a formula to check each cell of the calendar against the C5:C range and then, if true, assume the value of the cell 2 columns left (Column A) of the matched cell. I cannot figure out this formula to achieve this and I'm not super familiar with macros for Sheets.

My intended method is by no means the way I have to do it so I am open to any ideas for how to show this more effectively!

I am stuck in the formula at the part I underlined in red. If I replaced the ""???"" by ""B11"" then I would get ""5"". I want to replace ""???"" by some sort of range that would tell the sumproduct to give me the sum based on the ""Range from B11, which is 1 Jan, and the next 6 days"".

excel,Need assistance calculating a commission amount that changes based on the sale price.,"I have no idea if the way I wrote the title is correct, but this is generally what I need help with:

I'm a real estate agent and I need to figure out how to add a commission amount on excel, which for most deals is easy, just multiplying the sale by a certain percentage. However, for certain deals, I have a specific commission structure that changes based on the sale price, which is as follows.

For the first $250,000 of a sale price, the split is 50/50, for the next $250,000 the split is 60/40, and any amount above that is 70/30. Typical commission percentage from a sale is 2.5% of the sale price.

So, if I sell an $800,000 house, the first $250,000 of that is a 50/50 split, which comes out to $3,125. Then the next is 60/40 which is $3,750, and then the remaining $300,000 is calculated at 70/30 which is $5,250. Total is $12,125.

Now...how do I do that in excel? Any help would be super appreciated."

excel,"How to change a character in the following string ""00000""? (Can't use Replace()...)","Hello, I wasn't able to find a solution to this one and wanted to seek for help.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, Instead of creating 5 different Boolean variables for flag-checking purpose, i decided to get a little fancy and use one single string as a replacement to having those 5 variables.

Example below.

    Example 1:
    flag1 = false
    flag2 = false
    flag3 = false
    flag4 = false
    flag5 = false
    if True Then flag1 = True
    ' And repeat for other 4 flags...
    
    
    Example 2: What i want instead
    Dim smartFlag As String
    smartFlag = ""00000""
    If True Then smartFlag[0] = 1
    ' This above Example 2 won't work...

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to accomplish this? I saw Replace() function but i can't use this because of its required parameter for a character or sub-string to match against ""00000"".....

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I would like to keep this as a string ""00000"" format.

One other option i am trying to avoid is to convert the String variable to a Integer/Number variable and initially assigned it to 100000. Then afterward for each flag, it will just add 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1 respectively for each applicable flag

Other option is leaving it as a String but change the initial value to ""98765"" and for each applicable flag error, it updates the i-position string to 1 or 0. By leaving it to 98765, at least i can use Replace for identifying my intended index"

excel,Formatting Macros running slower than expected,"Hello!

I put together a spreadsheet which is running much more slowly then I expected. Ill describe the spread sheet and include the formula's and macro's used below. Just as a side note, I am dipping my toes into VBA and most of the macro was written with the record macro tool. Any help is appreciated!:

&amp;#x200B;

The spreadsheet mainly consists of a Named Table (Table1) which takes in data (Columns A:J) and two columns of formula's (columns K:L). I extended the table with the two formulas down 300 rows to account for most of our data pull sizes.

Column K formula Looks for a dollar amount within a string in a cell:

    =IF(F2 = """","""",MID(F2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789"")),FIND(""."",F2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789""))) - MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789"")) +3))

&amp;#x200B;

Column J is an array formula searches a string (Sentence) within a cell with key words in a list (Named List) and returns any keyword it finds. The formula was returning 0 if it found nothing so I wrote an IF statement around it.

    =IF(IFERROR(INDEX(List,MATCH(FALSE,ISERROR(SEARCH(List,J2)),0)),"""") = 0,"""",IFERROR(INDEX(List,MATCH(FALSE,ISERROR(SEARCH(List,J2)),0)),""""))
    

I am unsure if there is a better way to implement these two formulas. Perhaps see if there is a way to write the second formula without it being an array? Maybe apply it only to Row 1 and have a macro paste it down to cover only the row size of the data as opposed to 300 rows? I am not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I have 2 macros assigned to buttons ""Format"" and ""Reset"". Format applies a distinct format while reset clears the pasted data (not the formulas).

Format Macro:

I wanted to add a custom sort but it made the macro take even longer to run through.

&amp;#x200B;

Reset: The formula I found to remove filters seems to really extend the duration of this macro. Its technically a for loop that unfilters every table in my worksheet even thought I only have the one table. I tried other formulas such as cells.ShowAllData but nothing else worked.

    Sub Reset()

excel,Sort columns in a table - VBA,"So I have a pivot with transaction detail that we often click into a specific account to look at each individual transaction...

    Range(""F1"").Sort Key1:=Range(""F1""), Order1:=xlDescending

It sorts ok, but I noticed when I did ascending.. it doens't account for the fact its a table and it sorts the headers to the bottom.  (I really only need descending but for sake of curiosity I want to know how to do it with headers for potential future issues).

I'm trying to set up a project tracker. There are multiple milestones under each deliverable, and they can have status of: On Track, At Risk, Off Track, Complete (see image for example).

I'm trying to get the deliverable status to auto fill based on certain milestone status. For instance, in the first column, one milestone is off track, so I want the deliverable status to read as off track. In the third column, it should be on track. 

Essentially I want it to be ranked that if one of the milestones is off track, the deliverable is off track. If no milestones are off track, but one is at risk, it's at risk. If no milestones are off track or at risk, and all on track, the deliverable is on track.

I have a fairly interesting problem.
I need to determine if, when and by how much a project is to run out of stock.

Input tables: 

1.) Demand.
Demand by Month for each item broken into projects.
As an example, item X123 may have 4 projects with 4 different demand timelines.

2.) On hand inventory.
I have the current inventory in each project.
Inventory from projects cannot be transferred to other projects unless it comes from project AABB.

3.)External inventory.
This table contains all part numbers and the inventory that can be sent to AABB.

I have everything set up in the data model. I am still learning dax and would love some help. 

I have been using a post on the powerbi community ""calculate weeks of stock based on future demand"" to get me started.

excel,Pivot vs Countifs/Sumifs,"Hello,

excel,Model that weights SG in PGA &amp; European Tour Golf by the field's strength," Has anyone made a model that weights SG (shots gained) against the field weighted by the strength of each field?

I've categorised fields into 1 of 5;

\- Majors

\- Category 1 (strongest field outside of majors)

\- Cat 2

\- Cat 3

\- Cat 4

\- Cat 5 (weakest fields on either Euro/PGA Tour, i.e. none of the OWGR top 50, predominantly ranked 200-500).

I'm working out shots gained against the field in each event, then adjusting the standard scratch in each event, dependent on the strength of each field. I'm wondering how heavily I should weight this. I know Josh Culp/Numberball do this very well for those aware.

For example; Adam Scott won the AUS PGA with a total SG against the field of **15.97, averaging 3.99** per round.

I've categorised this as a CAT 3 event, with a fairly weak field.

This adjusts the SG against field for all players (i.e adjusting the Standard Scratch).Adam Scott's changes to the following using this formula:

**Total : 11.11**

**Average: 2.87**

Examples of other categories would be:

MAJORS - N/A

**CAT 1 (RAW SG/1.006) - Total: 14.42, AV: 3.56**

**CAT 2  (RAW SG/1.011) - Total: 12.81, AV: 3.20**

**CAT 3  (RAW SG/1.017) - Total: 11.11, AV: 2.87**

**CAT 4 (RAW SG/1.022) - Total: 9.71, AV: 2.43**

\--

All players are adjusted accordingly using this structure. Has anyone done anything similar or have suggestions? Do you think this either weighted enough, or not enough? Would be good to collaborate on ideas."
excel,How can I track a changing cell value over time and plot the changes automatically to a chart?,"It sounds simple but I have tried to google this and all solutions always use static data as input. 

I have an excel file (lets call it file A) with only one sheet and on it only a single cell with data in it (a number in the cell). The most simple excel file you can have. One sheet, one cell with a value. But the value automatically changes over time dependent on another excel file (file B). Right now the number is 10. The number however is not static data but is populated by reading from another excel file (file B) by using a simple COUNT function. The number is how many rows in file B on a specific column contain data - are not empty. So the function in the cell of file A is the following:

=COUNT('[file B.xlsx]Sheet1'!F:F)

where ""Sheet1"" is the sheet in the file B that contains a couple of rows with data. 

Sometimes, the number of rows with data in file B changes, so the number in the cell in file A will sometimes be 10, sometimes 8, sometimes 12, and whatever else depending on how many rows in file B contain data at a particular point in time. That means the number in the file A will vary depending on how many rows have data in them in the column F in file B.

*This is what I want to do: track the changes of this cell and show it on a graph.* For example, the value in the cell in file A is now 10 because the F column in file B contains only 10 cells with data, the rest are empty. If I go into file B and either remove or add a row with data in column F, the number in file A will increase or decrease, and that change should be tracked and displayed on a graph where the y axis is the number and x is time set to update each second, minute, hour or day and the charts x axis is going on into the future.

In the end, if I go in to file B that has 10 rows and add 5 rows within a minute, a chart should be updated that displays that first the value in file A was 10 and then next minute the value was 15. This should plot a line graph so if after a day the cell value always increased, the line is constantly going up and each step on the x axis is a minute, an hour or a day.

Perhaps I am over thinking it and this is easier than I think, but when I google this I get either examples using static time and value data - ie two columns that have static months and values each months, for example. Or people say ""this is easily built in to excel"" or ""you have to do this completely crazy vba script"". I cant think its that hard tracking and displaying cell values changes over time. Its simply plotting a graph from a cell which has a value that changes. It doesnt even have to be a cell that reads from another file either, you might as well have a cell with a static number, and if you manually change that number, the line chart updates with a new value and over time shows what different values the cell had minutes, hours, days or even months ago.

TLDR: I want to plot the value changes of a cell to a line chart automatically as time passes. Something like ""plot cell data changes automatically to a chart every minute""

Any ideas how to achieve this? It feels like basic Excel yet after days I still can't figure out how to even start since I don't have static data as input."

Only this file is messed up. I can't even copy and paste it into a blank book, so I don't feel like my macro is the problem.

excel,Looking to enter timestamps automatically and send me alerts every 4 hours on a spreadsheet used to track and record transactions.,"Hi all,

I have a spreadsheet that records transactions on a game I play. The sole purpose is to track profit/losses and maybe do some analyses on items from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hua456uwlpc41.png?width=1591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f0d0a027b54ac1ea9b95b11b8493bf9ab40acb

What I'd like to add is the ability to automatically fill the time (Column A) when i make a new entry. For example, when I add a new item name in column B, the time in column A will automatically be created based on the time its entered.

From here, I'd like to be able to create a function that alerts me as soon as 4 hours have passed. The reason being that items have certain buy limits every 4 hours. In B1696 for example, the 'Mazcab Ability Codex' can only be purchased 2 times every 4 hours.

I made a post last year similar to this and was told I can do this using VBA worksheet with the following code:

    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)     If Not Intersect(Target, Range(""A:A"")) Is Nothing Then         Dim time As Date         time = Target.Value         newTime = time + TimeValue(""00:00:05"")         Application.OnTime newTime, ""alert""     End If End Sub 

And this code inside a VBA module:

    Sub alert()     MsgBox ""4 hours that you bought an item"" End Sub
    
    I'll be honest. I have never used VBA before and was somewhat confused by this so any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

excel,"Challenge - Create a list of values from 1 to 100, set multiples of 3 to display as Duck, set multiples of 5 to display as Goose and multiples of both 3 and 5 as DuckGoose."," After 3 hours of trying different things, including my very first attempt at any kind of macros, I had very little to show for my attempt at this challenge.

My initial approach was to select the 1-99 list and use conditional formatting rules to highlight first multiples of 3 in red, then multiples of 5 in blue, and then multiples of 15 (3x5) in orange.

A sample conditional formatting formula used to highlight multiples of 3 was =MOD(A1,$M$3)=0, which looked at the list and divided each by cell M3, in which I had entered the number 3. I used similar formulas for 5 and 15.

My plan was then to use the Find and Replace feature to find cells with red formatting and replace them with 'Duck', blue cells with 'Goose' and orange with 'DuckGoose'. However, AFAIK Excel cannot use conditional formatting as a recognised formatting type to perform Find and Replace. Dead End.

I then typed 'Duck', 'Goose' and 'DuckGoose' in three separate cells. Then cntrl+c on 'Duck', and cntrl+click on every (red) multiple of 3, cntrl+v, which pasted 'Duck' into these cells. Then the same for Goose on blue cells, and DuckGoose on orange cells, which took &lt; 1 minute.

excel,Using EXCEL to convert between different types of names,"I'm a Biologist (lower end of experience with excel - just learned to use VLOOKUP the other day) stuck on a bit of a naming problem. One of my datasets spat out 15,000 cells of data, but with a useless naming scheme for the proteins. It used a protein accession name, whereas I want a gene name.

Background, every gene has multiple names. For example BRCA2 is the gene name (causes breast cancer when mutated), whereas ENSG00000139618 is the respective accession number.

I'm trying to go from accession name to gene name because subsequent analysis is 100x easier.

I'm trying to figure out if Excel can help me with a solution. I used a database to convert the accession names to gene names, but it discarded repeat inquiries (so if I have 7 incidences of A0A024QZP7, it only gave back 1 CDK1 entry (corresponding gene name)).

Here's what I envisioned as a fix:

Column A - Original list of data with their accession name.

Column B - Function to assess a sample in A, check it in column C, then paste in corresponding gene name from Column D.

excel,Challenge - DuckGoose (FizzBuzz) extended,"https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/espwsd/challenge_create_a_list_of_values_from_1_to_100 got some good responses. It got me thinking as to whether there is a ""generalized"" formula.

Assume there is a 2 column lookup table.  

Column 1 is the multiple.  
Column 2 is the word to display when a number is a multiple of the value in column 1.  

This table is R rows tall.  

Then assume we have another table listing the integers running from M to N where both are positive integers and N is larger than M.  For each value in this table, it should return the words from column 2 of the lookup table for each value in column 1 that is a multiple of.

So for example, if our lookup table had  

3 = Duck    
5 = Goose   
7 = Pigeon  

Then (selected values only)

3 = Duck    
5 = Goose    
7 = Pigeon    
15 = DuckGoose    
21 = DuckPigeon    
35 =  GoosePigeon     
105 = DuckGoosePigeon   


Is there a formula to return the correct text no matter how big the lookup table is?"
excel,"Conditional formatting a cell containing ""X/Y"" so it highlights the cell if X is equal or greater than Y","Hello,

As the title states, I need help with creating a conditional formatting rule so a cell containing ""X/Y"" will be highlighted if X is equal or greater than Y.

Here is an example table:

&amp;#x200B;

|Categories|Points|Points needed|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Category A|60/50|50|
|Category B|15/25|25|

&amp;#x200B;

In my Excel, I have multiple categories and I have summed them into the ""Points"" based on which category they are a part of using the =SUMIFS formula. If looking at Category A, I have Excel showing the ""/50"" part by adding &amp;""/""&amp;""50"" after the formula.

As this excel needs to be easy to read by just glancing at it, I want to be able to highlight a category if it has the points needed or exceeded it. So looking at the example table above, I want ""Category A"" and ""60/50"" to be highlighted as it has the required amount of points.

I hope there is some way of making a conditional formatting formula that makes it possible to leave the ""/50"" part in the excel so it is easy to read.

If you need more information, please ask.

Thank you."

excel,Web connection refresh issue,"I'm working on a dashboard that gets some data from a web source.

Now when the refresh button is used, all of the data is just copied and appended to the right of the existing table e.g. Columns A through T persist but now U through AN have the same data repeated.  

Repeating the refresh does not append the data on AO through whatever it would be, so it's like the initial macro-led data download isn't registering as the data to be overwritten or something.  I cannot find any information online on why this may be occurring.  Refreshing again Here are some facts I think might be relevant:

I've tried with ""Enable background refresh"" enabled and disabled.
There is a worksheet_change event on the data page that does seem to be triggering frequently during the data refresh.  Though when I comment out this block, the issue persists.

excel,Formula for predicting how much I'll make for the year,"I am a real estate agent.  I have a spreadsheet where I track all of my closings and income from real estate.  I use it not only to keep track of the all the info I need for my transactions, but also to track how much i make and for goal tracking.  As a salesperson, it is incredibly important to set goals and I use this spreadsheet to track my progress towards achieving those goals.

Currently, to estimate what my total income for the year will be,  I have a function that takes the currently amount of money I've made in the year and divides it by the amount of time it's taken to make that money.  For example, if the date is April 1st and I've made $10,000 so far; that's 1/4 of the way through the year and the spreadsheet estimates that I'll make $40,000 for the year.

Here's the problem: Most of my income is made in the summer.  I definitely don't have a straight line consistent income.  I can make very little money the first few months of the year.  Then, bam, spring hits and I make a lot.  This is where my predictive model veers of course, right after the spring market, I've made probably 80% of what I'm going to make for the year.  But my function thinks, ""Hey, he's kicking butt and there's still half the year left"".  My total income estimate skyrockets and then slowly comes down everyday back to reality as the end of the year approaches.

Below are three years worth of my monthly income.  Is there someway to use this data to make a formula or function that better predicts my total income for the year?

excel,Combining many similar files into a file with a template and all the data sets.,"Hi. First of all excuse my English. I don't always know how to correctly express myself.

At work I'm using excel (Office 365) to make documents for employees to track the quality of the manufacturing process (APQP - PPAP systems if you're familiar).  
This means that I have a separate excel file for every of the couple hundred products we make (and I need to change the format on pretty much all of them).  
In principal every document is the same. It has a fixed head with the product name/number and a table where workers enter their measurements. The tables are repeated depending on how many operations a particular product has. 

What I'm asking is how I could insert the operations for every product into a template which would automatically create as many tables as there are operations and also be able to set an arbitrary number of rows for the tables. Can this be done with macros? VBA? 

I'm currently using a different spreadsheet with the tooling info and a Word file with a template used for printing adressess on letters. This works but working with tables in Word gives me a headache. Another issue I can see is that for many products I need an image or a lot of text in the operation description which will probably screw with the formatting.

This is the form I'm currently using. The top half is the header which is only on the first page and below the product name is the table that gets repeated depending on the number of operations.
https://i.imgur.com/qE7WZmu.png

And if that wasn't enough I have more things to ask:

1. How can I keep record of the document revisions (version control)? I've seen a git extension for excel file diff but I have no way of testing it currently.

2. In the next few months we'll be trying an inventory system with Excel and Scan-IT to office app. Is a live excel file a good option for real time inventory tracking? Currently we have a proprietary solution that only tracks materials when a work order is printed but it can't account for the lost quantity due to operator error or damaged materials.

3. What literature/tutorials do you recommend me to check out if I'm mostly dealing with static data and table design? I don't think I need to learn any complex formulas or querry tools yet. 

Thanks for any and all help"

excel,Forcing INDEX / MATCH to return a blank instead of zero if matches to a blank?,"Minor annoyance that I have been having for years - I use INDEX / MATCH all the time to bounce specific logic against datasets by creating helper tables.  For instance, I have transactions for 1000 SKUs but I only want to review a specific list - I will create a helper table that contains a column with these SKUs (primary key) and a status ""INCLUDE"", then index/match to bring in the status into the main dataset and filter by the result in pivots, etc.

In almost all such cases, I wrap the index/match in an IFERROR to result in a blank if no match is found in MATCH.lookup\_array.  However, if a match is found in MATCH.lookup\_array AND INDEX.array results in a blank (example data: SKU, """" which would be the case for all SKUs that exist on the helper table without a status for whatever reason), the formula will return a zero instead.  I have been very inelegantly solving for this by wrapping the IFERROR ( INDEX / MATCH ) in an IF statement that looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    =IF
       (
        IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")=0
        ,""""
        ,IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")

Clearly, this is a very clunky way to code in Excel as I am repeating the same formula twice, need to update twice, etc.  It works, but not ideal.  Anyone happen to know of a better way?

&amp;#x200B;

So at my work i've been trying to create a dependent dropdown list that depends on another list. I can accomplish that somewhat successfully but with blank spaces on the list and that is not ideal. For professional reasons i can't give my exact list but it would be something along these lines (format wise):

Three words cell    ;      Few words cell

Three words cell    ;      Lot of words cell

Cell                ;            Many words cell

Two words cell      ;       Some words cell

One word cell       ;       Some something

Three words cell    ;      Something something


So i tried named ranges but since i have spaces in the text im having some issues. I tried creating a column for each value in the left, but the columns would have different lengths which would result in empty cells, although that is the closest i got from what i wanted.
Im on a windows computer and im not sure the excel version since i left it at work, but its recent (office 365 i believe).

I've tried to automate this pasting in Python. This sometimes works, but pasting the dataset seems to be on the edge of what this computer can handle, and a 50% success rate is not good enough to script it.  Is there a faster way to do this (amenable to scripting or not)?

excel,Merging queries causes expanded columns to error.,"I have an issue where, after I merge two queries, a few columns that previously had contents all report error instead. 

Details:

Query pulls in a report (off salesforce), and then appends the exact same report for different years - these all have the exact same columns/data types, but for different years - so it starts at the report for 2018, then appends 2019, then 2020. 

Then, I expand two columns that contain [Record] data - the records contain an amount and currency, and I expand them into two columns, one for the amount, and one for the currency. So, [Record] -&gt; xxxxxx.xx, USD. Since there’s two columns with these record types, I get a total of four columns from expanding these two. 

Then: I merge (left, outer) another query that adds in additional text columns for each line, based on a column in each query - each item in the column selected in the original query matches an item in the column select in the query to be merged.

Here’s where the problem happens: this merge causes all four of the expanded columns (which again, were amount and currency, amount and currency), instead report error. 

What I’ve tried: I’ve tried expanding the two columns after the merge, but merging before expanding causes the [Record] to turn into text, and loses the option to expand because it’s just text that says [Record]. 

No idea why this is happening, since the merge shouldn’t (?) do anything to any of the columns except just add some columns to the right? Help, please!"

For a volunteer events, I have to create schedules for my teams. Pictured is the most recent one that I did manually. Doing this manually is like playing Sudoku, so I’d love to find a way to make this easier. However, I fear there’s way too many complex rules…? Here’s the run down on these:

* Every event usually starts and ends at a different time
* Every event usually has a different number of teams
* Every event usually has a different number of zones (anywhere from 2-6, typically)
* The letters are zones at the event, the numbers on the left are the team numbers
* Sometimes there are different numbers of teams allowed in a zone at a time
   * In this case, we generally wanted at least one team in A and at least two teams each in of the other lettered zones at a time
* Sometimes events have dinner breaks, sometimes they don’t
* Breaks can’t occur within the first hour or the last hour of the event
* The amount of teams who can be on a break at one time depends on how many teams there are
   * In this case, two teams could be on a break at a time, excluding the minutes of overlap for when they’re going/coming back
* Generally, we like teams to not stay in one zone for too long, and we want each team to experience as many zones as possible for fairness
* Sometimes we have a couple flex teams who go where we need them at the time or who roam anywhere except when covering breaks for other teams

excel,Creating a dropdown of unique values from a column in a table,"Hello,

I know how to do this in many steps, but I'm wondering if there's an easier way:

I have a table named Inventory.  On that table there is a column titled ""Area"" and another titled ""Owner.""  I want to create dropdowns for countifs statements based on those two columns.  Obviously I could manually create the dropdowns, or create a unique list from that column and name that as the list, or create a pivot and copy/paste the list, but what I'd like to figure out is if I can write some sort of formula in the Data Validation page that creates this list automatically for me.

excel,Cleaning up a messy data table in VBA,"I've been tasked with taking a chart of data that's not at all easy to consolidate, and put it in an easy to analyse format.

Original data is setup almost like a calendar, a 4x6 matrix of blocks, with each block containing 14 cells in a 2x7 format that each can contain data or remain blank. To the left of each row of blocks in the 4x6 is a merged cell containing a date. 

&amp;#x200B;

|A1 Block 1|B1 Block 1|C1 Block 2|D1 Block 2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A2 Block 1|B2 Block 1|C2 Block 2|D2 Block 2|

I've managed to write VBA to consolidate all of this data into one table with a new row for each 1x2 data pair from the original blocks, but now I'm trying to clean it.

This data is entered by hand, required output is product\_code : # of cases. Following is how the majority of the data is setup:

&amp;#x200B;

|428392|1500 cs||
|:-|:-|:-|
|392342/392393|100 cs + 200 cs||
|302302/420234|600 cs ea||

First row is easy, I can just strip the cs off the end. But I'm struggling how to handle the second two. 

If it's the second row with 2 pids separated by a /, and 2 case amounts separated by a +, how can I split that into two individual rows in the table?

Similarly with the last case, splitting the Pids into two rows with 600 cs on each.  
This would cover about 95% of the data, the rest could be manually cleaned by hand. Any help would be appreciated!!

If it helps, following is part of the code I've used to manipulate the data into one table:

excel,Checkboxes to populate worksheet from templates,"Hello, my use case is similar to [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2ykalj/using_a_macro_to_insert_a_sheet_from_a_template/)

I want to have a series of check boxes on a main page, with numbers beside them that correspond to separate template files. 

When you click the check boxes, I want the contents of the separate template file to be added after the first page in the sequence they are checked, think long-form.

Then, when that template is no longer needed, un-checking the box removes the specific page, and its corresponding contents.

The intended purpose is room management, with specific details needing to be added for each room, but the room usage changes frequently, so that's why it's important for that data to be removed when unchecked.

The audience for this is pretty non-technical, which is why I need for it to work in this fashion, instead of just adding new sheets to the workbook. They will need to print it out daily, so if it isn't possible to remove the added pages, then a lot of paper could be potentially wasted.

excel,What is the best VBA practice for sending out large amounts of emails by creating single file spreadsheets from multiple tabs within a single spreadsheet? Any other multi-store corporate analysts out there operating primarily in Excel?,"TL;DR I am trying to find a way in Excel VBA to use a named range of words to search for that exist in a certain spreadsheet's tabs names to export all tabs that contain that word to a single excel file. Example: In cells A1 I have my first search term ""NYC."" Spreadsheet tabs that contain this name exist in the excel file: NYC Sales by Type, NYC Sales by Individual, NYC AR Headhunt Status. I want to take all these tabs that have the word ""NYC"" in them, export to an excel file, and email it out all in one VBA step.


This VBA would result in the production of many files that contain several tabs each. One file for NYC, one file for LAX, etc., each of which has all the tabs that contain the original tab ""search"" term (in the example of the paragraph above, the search term is ""NYC""). 

The next step would be adding a named range of email addresses to send each specific file to in VBA: e.g. all of the NYC sales staff emails are placed into a named range which the VBA then references and opens up Outlook (or whatever the Windows default email app is) and possibly sets the subject of the email.


I've written some VBA and use some Excel Add-Ons like ASAP Utilities to automate the export of the individual location spreadsheets to individual files, but each of these solutions is imperfect and requires time-consuming manual steps each time (VBA code has hardcoded names of spreadsheets, which from time to time for different reasons change (e.g. ERP export of source data uses a slightly different report name)).


The business has a few dozen locations that all receive several reports weekly and monthly, laid out identically each with their own performance data. All of the excel reports are automated processes except for the process of emailing. Ideally, our ERP would do this out of the box but it's ancient and even the newer versions of it don't provide human-readable reports.

Any other analysts out there working for a multi-store business using just Excel? Any tips?"

excel,"Power Query: Manually add entries to table, without them being overwritten with the next refresh","Hi guys, 

sorry for the wall of text, I tried to explain as much as possible about the situation.

I create a monthly export from SAP which contains production related data, lets call it ""export.xlsx"".
I load the data from export.xlsx into a second file (""data.xlsx"") with Power Query and create one conditional column (""Comment needed?"") where I check whether the value in a previous column (""Runtime"") exceeds a certain value. 

Example for ""data.xlsx"", if the runtime value is &gt;10, a ""Yes"" will be added to the last column, else a ""No"" will be added.

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|
|002|Team 1|6|No|
|003|Team 2|5|No|
|004|Team 2|15|Yes|

If the value was exceeded, I need to get feedback from the responsible team in form of a comment.

Now I didn't want to have multiple people access data.xlsx, so I figured I could just create separate files for each team containing their comments (lets call them ""team1.xlsx"" and ""team2.xlsx"") and have ""data.xlsx"" pull the comments via a query.

So ""team1.xlsx"" would also contain a query pulling the data from ""data.xlsx"" relevant to Team 1 and add a conditional column called ""Comment"", where the comments should go.

Example ""team1.xlsx"", if the column ""Comment needed?"" contains a ""Yes"", then the new column ""Comment"" should contain the phrase ""Please insert comment here"":

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Please insert comment here|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|

Now someone from team1 can open ""team1.xlsx"" and put in a comment for order ID 001:

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Runtime 11 hours due to machine malfunction|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|

And I can pull those comments into ""data.xlsx"" via a query, works just fine.
The problem I have now is that this comment gets overwritten with ""Please insert comment here"" as soon as the query in ""team1.xlsx"" gets loaded again.

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Please insert comment here|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|


Any ideas how I can preserve the comments?

I guess I somehow need to have PQ check if there are comments which don't equal ""-"" or ""Please insert comment here"" and then preserve these. But no idea how.

I thought about adding the ""comment column"" manually to the table in ""team1.xlsx"" but then I run into problems if the sequence of order IDs somehow gets mixed up.

Thanks in advance!"
excel,Summing values from strings more elegantly,"Hi all;
on mobile, will flair soon. Not at work so pic of my current workbook (and process) will be added in like 7 hours.

Anyway, I work at a paint company and am our primary custom color match-er.  For colorant we use “drops” as our base unit, 48 drops = 1 ounce (y), 32y= 1 quart. So I might use the notation of 1qt2y24 for a single color hit. Several hits later I have a color match.  

When it’s all said and done, I add up my hits for total colorant added. Rows 1-4 are batch and related info, column 1 below the info lists the colorants for that color. Columns 3+ are my individual hits. [heres my sample color match](https://imgur.com/a/aGnN1AI)

Currently method is taking an individual colorant, splitting it into the ounces and drops, putting them into a column of each, summing them and getting creative with the MOD and QUOTIENT functions. 

My questions  are 1) can I parse multiple “1qt2y3” with similar but varying structure, ie there may not be qts or drops; “1qt4y” or “3y”. 2) Is there a good way to have a properly formatted calculated cell? Best I can figure would be conconcatinating calculated cells with text.

What I want:
I need a formula that returns the value (contract number) to the cell, where the check-in date was before date 2.

I have a sheet with all the data and another sheet with the Personal Number and Date 2. 

So explained:
If I have the date 10/03/2019, I need my formule to return the contract number that's checked in on 10/03 or a couple of days before that based on the 'Personal Number'

I'm assuming I can use the personal number for that, but I tried all match, indexs and everything but I can't get it to work.

Thanks in advance! KR Vince

If anyone makes a formula, let's say:
Personal number is cell A:A
Date 2 is cell B:B
Contract numbers are in C:C
Check-in date is D:D

If Date 2 (B:B) contains a value/date, Cell E should show the last contract based on the personal number (A:A)"

excel,Simple way to remove used items from data validation drop down lists?,"I'm working on somewhat of a makeshift fantasy football platform and would like to create a draft page. My hope is to have one sheet with every available player as the data to be validated in every drop down list (I hope I'm using the terminology correctly) and a separate sheet with a drop down list in every cell for teams to select their players.

In order for this to function in the best way possible for what I'm trying to accomplish, I'll need each previously selected item to be removed from the remaining, unselected cell lists.

I've searched the internet a good bit but I keep getting redirected to this one blog that provides a much more complicated method than what I have the skills or patience for, especially because it seems incredibly time-consuming considering my large amount of data (\~1500 cells of data).

Is there an easier way to accomplish this than all the =IF(COUNTIF and =OFFSET formulas and naming the group or whatever? Or is anyone aware of a site that would allow me to input all my player data then select players in the manner I'm trying to accomplish?

Sorry if this is confusing. I'd be happy to go into greater detail if necessary. I'm very much a novice in the ways of Excel and need guidance."

I'd like to find a way to merge them all into one big spreadsheet that has all students and all dates from one semester.

I'd just do the old copy paste, but I know this is going to run me into a lot of issues because of transient students.  So some of my sheets have overlapping names, some of them have names that are missing, and some have new names.  Is there any way I can merge these together, and anytime there's a new name (row), it just appends it to the document, and anytime there's a new date (column) it does the same thing, so I end up with one giant database?  Ideally I'd like to not have to do it by hand.  We're not a giant high-school, but there's still almost 1500 students on the sheet, and going through 18 weeks worth of docs will be a nightmare!

I'm fairly competent with Excel, rules, conditional formatting, pivot tables etc. but I'm struggling with this one. The only way I can think to get around it would be to add an additional column using the DAY() function, and then CF when values in \*that\* column=26, but I would prefer not to add more columns/values to my document.  I'm sure there is a simpler way I could do this, just can't figure out what formula I need for my CF.

I am trying to make the data set more accessible for employees, so I am creating a summary page with some key information (see image)

Basically, the user would be able to manually input the category &amp; product number, then select the FOB QTY from the drop down. 

The formula would then grab the Product #, the FOB QTY selected from the drop down, and produce the cost for that product. 

My first thought was to do nested IF functions based on the drop down, with a vlookup referencing the SKU number. But with 12 options that is a massive nested IF function.

excel,A macro to email myself a month before a defined date?,"I keep track of 800+ certifications that have expiration dates. It would look something like this:  


Name        | Expiration  
John Doe   | 4/3/2020

repeated many times with an array of different dates. Is there a way to have Excel email me a month before, on 3/3/2020 with the information in the ""name"" column? If so, would I be able to easily tweak it to make it more specific? I'm wondering if I can have it sent to different people based on a 3rd column, like so.  


Name        | Expiration   | Manager Name  
John Doe   | 4/3/2020     | Jane Doe (nepotism right?)

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, the perfect solution would be that on 3/3/2020, it emails Jane with 

""Name        | Expiration  
John Doe   | 4/3/20200""

How big of an ask is this/would it be something that is easily tweakable should the need arise? Thanks for any insight you can provide."

On the pivot you can see that the date column goes from August directly to December, is this because its arranged alphabetically?

excel,Dynamic subtotals ranges,"I am trying to better my invoice sheet. I have 5 categories that all have different line-items to go with that category. I used to just have a lot of blank rows with drop down menus to select what line-item will be added. The rest of the row populates with what line-item was entered, and at the bottom of the category there was a sub-total cell that would calculate what was input. Then, at the very bottom of the sheet, it adds up all of the subtotals to one total.

I have recently slimmed down my sheet a lot by eliminating the extra rows under each category. Now each category has one row. Now, when you double click that row it creates a new one below it, copying all of the formulas in the line above.

With this added, my subtotal no longer works. So I would assume I need the subtotal range to be dynamic, but I have no idea how to tell it to do that. Because now, some categories may have 3 line-items, while others have 15, but I can't get the subtotal to follow that. Any help would be appreciated.

excel,Big problem big challenge - pivot chart changes chart type upon slicer use,"Hey fellow sheet heads - got an urgent and big problem.

I have a data model set up - Calendar table (linked to headcount and spend), Headcount table, Spend table, and country reference table (linked to headcount and spend)

I've set up a pivot table with the date as teh rows, the Headcount measure and Spend measure in the values, and the country in the columns

The pivot chart based off this is a combo chart showing spend and headcount over time, split by country.

Easy peasy right, except when i change the slicer (country), the actual chart type reverts back to a bar from (from the combo chart)

One interesting this is that if i remove Country from the columns on the pivot table, then the chart type maintains formatting when using filters. Something about adding the country to the pivot table itself makes it revert to default formatting

I've looked online and seems to be an issue for a lot of people and there are a lot of weird methods to overcome this. I've tried a couple to no avail. Has anyone encountered this? Has anyone got a best solution to hand? there's so many variations of this same issue it's hard to identify the correct and simplest solution!

Edit\* to add this is only happening with the country slicer, the date slicer maintains formatting

2nd edit - seems like this is a big old problem, i really hope someone has a solution!!

The column consists of a repetition of five categories (such as admin and literature research) in a fairly random sequence. As its an ever-growing list, the last entry will keep on going down.

I have tried several formulae in Excel2013, but this one came the closest to functioning:

    =HYPERLINK(""[MyBook.xlsx]Sheet1!$H$""&amp;MATCH(CHAR(255);H:H;1)+1;""Last entry"")

With *closest to functioning*, I mean that it worked until I changed the first column identifier `$H$` from a `B` to an `H`. It stopped working, so I changed it back and then it all fell apart seemingly.

I have based my formula on one found on a [website](https://www.get-digital-help.com/quickly-jump-to-last-row-in-a-data-set-using-excel-hyperlink-function/), because I am one of those people fairly proficient in computers because they know how to use a search engine. Hopefully, I have a problem that you have ideas about solving."
excel,Multiple Timeline Slicers Based On Multiple Date Tables?,"Hi r/excel,

First time poster here and I hope you can help (Office 365 Business). I have been trying to analyze a dataset and I have two different date columns I want to filter a chart by in pivot tables (Date Sold, Closed Date). I have a date table in power pivot with a relationship with Date Sold.

However, if I add in both Date Sold and Closed Date to a pivot table, and tie it to a timeline slicer using the date table that has a relationship with Date Sold, the Closed Date data doesn't show correctly. I think it is using the relationship to Date Sold as a filter as it shows the same values as date sold, but the correct values if i use a different pivot table without a timeline slicer, but matching manual date filter. [Pic Here](https://imgur.com/mekucPM)

I assume I cannot get around this, please tell me I am wrong.

As a work around I am trying to use two separate pivot tables, and make a chart using cell references using those two outputs. I created a second date table in power pivot and created a relationship between that and Date Closed. I am looking to make reports using these, so I am adding slicers for ease of use. 

Here is the problem: If I want a second timeline slicer using Date Closed, I cannot create one. Excel shows a loading icon and nothing appears, and there is nothing to undo. I can create date slicers, but that is a lot of manual clicking for what I am looking for, and i don't want repeat months, I need a timeline. 

[What I am looking for but with timeline!](https://imgur.com/IUZ9pmM)

Any advice?

TLDR: Using a second date table in power pivot to create a second timeline slicer for a separate pivot table doesn't work for me?"

excel,How to make a search bar that filters all rows that are not what is searched? Similar to the data table (DT) package in R.,"Morning,

I have a data set that has about 400 people on it, it's a very simple data set with 

Column A -&gt; Team Number 
Column B -&gt; First Name 
Column C -&gt; Last Name 


I need to create a search feature where a coworker can simply type either the first or last name in a cell and the data set can automatically be filtered and only showing matching names. 

I know I can do conditional format to highlight the matching cell but to save time for my coworker, they simply want the data table to be filtered and only show matching names. 


For example if they type ""Walker"" 

They would only want the people with the name ""Walker"" to appear. 
They don't want to use control+F or have to scroll through the data to see a highlighted row. 

I know this can be done in R with the DT package , but that coworker does not have R installed on their laptop, and I don't want to go through the trouble of having to host a shiny app to get this to work. 


Is this possible in excel? Should I use Access instead?

excel,Total beginner here. How can I use drop down menu that pull certain data (several variables) and calculates results on user input variables.,"Hi

Sorry this is rather difficult for me to describe  hence why I'm including an image.

* I work with around 10-20 nutritional products (main focus is on 3 variables; energy, protein and fibre)
* on most days I need to make up regimens from those products and this involves selecting a product to meet energy and then I need to work out total volume over number of hours (from this I get amount in ml/hour).

What I would like to create is document where

* I have a drop down selection of said products
* the drop down pulls the information (energy, protein, fibre)
* I input the amount of calories required and total volume total calories and total protein and fibre is calculated based on the selection from drop down menu.
* I input number of hours and it calculates the rate in ml/hr based on total volume

I suppose I could work with basic formulas here (as per screenshot) but I just want to know who to get the data to be pulled on selection from drop down menu.

I have typed the formulas and what data they pull from where. but like I have said i would like this to be ""automated"" by just drop down selection

PS&gt; the image does not have fibre but the calculation would be the same as per protein....

\- I've found Index Match can have issues if you don't remove the ""Sheet1!"" that occurs when you're moving between sheets to select the MATCH(lookup value.

\- Using Auto-Fill (double clicking the green box) to populate visible cells when your data is filtered may not work as intended.  You must you copy and paste to populate only and all filtered cells

\- You must make sure VLOOKUPs/Index Match lookup array have all unique values or you risk returning an incorrect value.

\- When adding a column to the right of a filtered data set, if you don't reapply the filter to include the new column, its data won't be attached to its intended row.

That's all that comes to mind right now, but I know there is more.  Anyone else find anything?  It would also be great to have an explanation of why it causes issues to better understand the behavior of Excel."

I want to split this cell out so that 111111-11 is in a row, 222222-22 is in a row and 333333-33 is in a row. All of the information in the other columns will be the same.

excel,Excel network links - network reference changing on its own,"Hi guys.

So I normally avoid too many links between workbooks, particularly in different network locations, but the company I’m working for at the moment *loves* them. As about 35 workbooks, literally thousands of links in each one. The kind of thing you really want a proper database or a BI suite for, but no one will pay for.

The problem is that these links have a bit of a habit of changing when you open the files.

For reference, the references are basically all:

V:\Site A\Admin\Finance\...

There are also a few links which read in the more traditional network way:

\\SiteDrive\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance\...

(For clarity, SiteDrive is the physical disk in the server at head office, Site1 is the folder which we have mapped as V:)

Either style of link works. The problem is that when you open some of the files, excel kind of hybridises the two reference styles, so I get:

V:\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance

So it’s inserting the folder from the second style into the first. There isn’t a Site1 folder on the V drive, so obviously the formula don’t evaluate.

I’ve never seen it do it before, it doesn’t do it in every workbooks (some it’s fine every time I open them), in the sheets that are affected, it doesn’t do it every time, and when it does, it doesn’t do it to every formula.

As things stand, I’m just doing a find and replace to correct it when I open the file, but I’m handing this process off to someone who had never opened excel 6 months ago and hasn’t got the strongest computer skills in general, so I’d rather not leave him needing to edit network links in basically any file he opens.

Anyone got any ideas about why it might be doing this or if these somewhere I can dig around to stop it happening?"
excel,Custom sort that ignores certain values,"Hello

I am the owner of a spreadsheet, in which i have create a list fra a data set using a simpel ""=data set cell"" and the filtering and sort that list.  
So far i have only needed to sort be 2-3 value in one columnand then sort the rest of the dates in a different column.

My boss loves this list, and now want to add tags in that first column - but the kicker is that these shouldnt be sorted according to this value, but only by the date column. So far i have tried adding them to the bottom of my custom sort list, but this just means that the are still sorted above the others with the same date.

I am hoping for some kind of workaround, where i can tell Excel to ignore these tags and just sort them as if they didnt exist (but they should still be visible)."
excel,Changing date format so it will work in a formula,"I have been assigned a massive data input tast that involves moving information from a lot of different spreadsheets into one ""master"" spreadsheet for analysis later.

excel,Finding a way to automatically detect similar non-overlapping shipment trend,"Hi guys! 

Not exactly looking for a solution, but just thought I should ask in case anyone had encountered something similar.

My current project requires me to identify possible products that may have taken another.

e.g. SKU A might be taken over by SKU B due to a change in packaging size, but the total weight shipped should still follow the same trend as SKU A. so what I need to do is match SKU As to their respective SKU Bs, so that I can use the historical shipments of A to conduct forecasting. 

My current approach is largely to eyeball it. I have my data sorted by SKU code, with the monthly shipment across, like below:

|SKU|Dec 2019|Nov 2019|Oct 2019|Sep 2019|Aug 2019|Jul 2019|Jun 2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|00001-A|2250||1500|||||
|00002-B||||125|250||375|
|00003-C|||||2250|1500||
|00004-D||2250|1500||2250|750|750|

With the example above, I would link SKU A with SKU C, since C stopped shipping around the same time (and before) A starts, as well as at similar loads (1500-2500, B is much more different cause it's only in the hundreds).

With 40 months worth of data, and some blanks here and there, i was thinking  there should be a more efficient and accurate way to link potential SKUs up, or at least highlight them?

Cheers!"

excel,Pulling transactions from sheet based on month and category,"So i have an excel sheet (actually google docs, but the same formulas would mostly apply) where I keep all my transaction history. This includes date of transaction, vendor, amount, category of spending (e.g. rent, grocery, eating out, entertainment, etc) and a description.

I then have a totals tab where i am able to see for each month the total in each category.

The issue i am now facing is this: Sometimes i'll look at a category of spending and it will be super high. Now in order to dig into where i spent the money i have to go back into my source sheet and manually go line by line and look at the categories and see what i spend. This is a bit cumbersome as i have 100's of transactions a month, plus scanning like this doesn't yield the kind of insights i'd like.

What i now want to do is create some kind of summary table where i can select the month or date range i want to check, and specify the category, and have it show me all transactions in the category, or by vendor etc.

How do i do that? As i mentioned, i have all this data in google sheets. if someone know how to do it directly in sheets that would be awesome, otherwise if you tell me the excel solution i can then see if sheets has something similar."

excel,VBA grab data for each sheet in a for loop,"Hi,  

I've unsuccessful tried to get data from closed files dynamically, but I think I may have found a workaround using VBA. I just need help to get it working :)   

I'm building a worksheet that has to reference a bunch of other files, but I don't want to have to hard code them into my sheet (as that would mean having to update the sheet every time someone gets added/removed from the company). So far, I have managed to automatically import the name of all the files in the timesheet directory into some cells in the ""setup sheet""   

Every following sheet then grabs a name from that list and has it in A1. That means You have ""Setup Sheet"", then ""Sheet 2"" grabs the first file name on the list, then ""Sheet 3"" grabs the 2nd one and so on.

From there, all the ""Sheet X"" sheets have a dummy link. Think ""C:\\files\\\[dummy.xlsx\]Sheet1'!A1""  
I need VBA to go through every sheet past the first one, and then grab the content of A1 in that specific sheet, and then do a search and replace, searching for ""dummy"" and replacing by the content of A1.   

Is this possible? Would it then automatically link to all of my files, or will it pop the ""make a connection"" window even if given the full path?

excel,Having trouble summing multiple instances by part of a date,"For work I have to summarize the total number of items sorted per hour for various locations over a 6 month period. The data that I was provided with is all raw and an example of it is as follows:

[Column A                                     Column B                          Column C  ](https://preview.redd.it/0eicas12r7c41.png?width=393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=997bd7c1b30b6b75675c1da54ffeef83e5727926)

&amp;#x200B;

On the left is the date **Column A**, in the middle is the locations **Column B**, which are designated as starting with INTLCM and PFOD, so one location like BRANT will need to sum INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT, and on the right is the items flagged per hour for that location **Column C**. What I need to do is summarize all instances of data for a location on each day, ideally also omitting any numbers below 60.

To clarify, what I'm trying to do is write a formula that will tell me how many items BRANT processed an hour for each day. So I need to sum the total number in **Column C** that corresponds with INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT for a day (EG 2019-05-28), then divide that total by the number of instances of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT appeared on 2019-05-28.

So for example; if the total sum of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT on 2019-05-28 is 5000, and there are 5 instances of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT on 2019-05-28 in total, I need the formula to spit out ""1000"".

What I've used so far is

=ROUNDUP(IF(COUNTIFS(A2:A215,G3,B2:B215,E9),SUMIF(B2:B215,E9,C2:C215)+SUMIF(B2:B215,E37,C2:C215),"""")/(COUNTIFS(A2:A215,G3,B2:B215,E9)),0)

&amp;#x200B;

G3 is the date, written as 2019-05-28. Most data also includes time, so the dates appear as 2019-05-28 01:00:00, though I can delete the time manually. 

E9 is one part of the text I need to filter by, in this case INTLCM-BRANT

E37 is the other part of the text I need to filter by, in that case PFOD-BRANT

In reality the ranges need to be in A:A, B:B, and C:C form as the data extends down way farther than you could scroll. So far though I can't seem to manage to get it to ONLY filter by date, as when I write the formula was A:A, B:B, and C:C it just counts everything that a specific location like INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT did. I need to be able to do this for every day between 2019-05-28 and 2020-01-21.

&amp;#x200B;

excel,How to remove elements that do not fall within a specific range and calculate without them?,"I apologize if I'm bothering anyone here, just a question for a college class.

Essentially we have about 700 data points sorted into something like 145 columns as per the assignment requirement, we were required to find the mean and standard deviation for each of these columns. Easy enough, we all got to that point. We then had to find plus and minus four standard deviations from the mean, and we are supposed to remove the data points that do not fall within this range and recalculate the mean and standard deviation. We were able to find the range values we needed, but eliminating the values not within this range has proved to be a pain. No one can seem to come up with a good way to do this.

I've read on a few resources that you can use the AND function to define a range, but it only returns true or false. I also saw somewhere that COUNTIF could work, but I'm not sure how to plug that into a formula that would ultimately result in finding the average or the standard deviation.

We've all been thrown into this class with little to no Excel experience and this is the very first assignment we've been given. Please talk to us like we're 5. We could really, really use it.  Our professor isn't helping and this is quite possibly our last resort.

excel,"Comparing 2 sheet columns, returning third value only if matching","Excel 2010.

I'm trying to cut down busy work by allowing excel to compare a column on sheet 1 to one on sheet 2, and filling in a value from sheet 2 onto sheet 1. 

Example:

Sheet 1 has Columns A (Name), B (Sales), C (Credit Card Sales) and D (Credit Card Sales Percentage)

Sheet 2 has Columns A (Name) and B (Credit Card Sales)

Because of the way my company does reports, the sales report and the credit card sales report are two different reports and every day I need to turn it into one.

One difficulty is that there will always be some names that got 0 credit card sales, so their names will not populate on sheet 2.  This means I need a way to compare names, and return a 0 in Sheet 1 column C if there is no name match.  If there is a name match, then the credit card sales need to populate in S1 column C.  The two lists will not have the same number of names.

So sheet 1 could have 8 people, sheet 2 could have 5 people, but there needs to be an entry for each person in S1 column C.

I need to understand not only what to do but how it does it because if I can get this working I can use the same functions for other reports, saving several hours of tedium.

My end goal is to get a pivot table, that has the months as rows, and “yes” “no” as columns and then the counts of how many machines are “yes” or “no” active and on both MIF and devices reporting. 

Hopefully this makes sense. I need to get this set up and done and I can see that it is super close.

    =COUNTIF(F:F,""*""&amp;G:G&amp;""*"") - my current formula

For example, if my **List of Keywords** contain (ABC, DEF, GHI), in the ""Evaluate Formula"" it would show:

Then, I tried to use to add a custom delimiter to it then open in excel, but it never opens the way I envision it too. The one way that would work is if I could use 2 delimiters were a 1 paragraph mark means to move into the next column and 2 paragraph marks in a row means move down 1 excel row (start of a question) --- I have no idea if this is possible or how to do it.

**What I want described more:** Below I have copied and pasted a dummy example. The letters in red are where I want the specific pieces from a word doc to import to in an excel file **(THE SPECIFIC CELLS).** Basically, I want each question to fill up 1 row and each part of a question moves over 1 column. When a new question starts I want it to start at a new row. So question 1 would fill row 1, question 2 would fill row 2, question 3 would fill row 3. The word documents are always structured the same way with 1 paragraph mark separate parts of the question and 2 paragraph marks separating questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dashboard worksheet in a workbook saved to a specific location: ""C:\\Documents\\Estimating-Controlled\\Development\\tools\\dashboard.xlsx""

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a folder that contains all the workbooks that need this dashboard added: ""C:\\Documents\\Estimating-Controlled\\Development\\build\\""

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to do is modify the code in the below link to:

1. Open the closed dashboard workbook
2. Move the dashboard worksheet to the first workbook in the build folder
3. Close the dashboard worksheet without saving
4. Save and close the updated workbook in build
5. Repeat.

Any help or tips will be appreciated. Or maybe a better solve? I'm open to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Not Sure,"I need two specific cells in two columns to be summed and that number put into a cell on another spreadsheet. I am currently using an IndexMatchMatch formula when there is only one number. When there has only been one unique number I was writing =VALUE(LEFT(B20,2)) to get the number from the cell.

I am not sure how to work with two numbers though. I have already tried to separate the two numbers by just putting 24 and 25 in rows next to each other but my director says no, they want to see them in a joint cell.

How can I sum the two cells for column 24 and 25 that correspond with row 1 of the pivot table. (I know the cell for 25 is blank but in most other cells in the column it is not.)

This is partially fine as I want all the ID's to just be displayed on a single row. But what I also want to achieve the following (use attached image as a guide):

1. Within the date column (column R) of my attached image, I want only the **earliest** date found across all rows for a specific ID to only be displayed.

I do not believe what I seek is possible but I have the following issue:

In column A, rows 1, 2 and 3 I have names written in English.

In column B, respective rows I need the names in Cyrillic letters.

I need a formula which does something like the following:

1. Take the name in $A1 and start checking character by character
2. Input each character to $B1

I do not see how this is possible with a formula and secondly, I fear that there are two letters which form a single sound (which equals a single letter), e.g. ""Ch"" and ""ph""in Christopher equal one single letter in Cyrillic.

Any ideas are welcomed!

**Edit:**  onceinamelon request a few more examples, please find them below:

Jack, Ali and Bernard are inputs in A1, A2 and A3 respectively.

B1, B2 and B3 must contain respectively their pronunciations in Cyrillic: Джак, Али, Бернард.

The only way I see this to happen is to check character by character in the respective cell and match the English letter to the Cyrillic letter."

excel,Our hyperlinks keep breaking and then linking files in appdata/roaming. Is there a better way to link to another document in excel?,"We are using Excel 2016 to compile our statistics. Each member has their own individual file, so when we compile statistics, we include a hyperlink beside their name that links to their personal file.

Every few weeks the list of hyperlinks breaks. Suddenly it links to a file in appdata/roaming and we are unable to open the links. We need to manually go through and relink the hyperlinks to the proper files.

If its relevant, the files we are linking to are on a network. There doesn't seem to be any particular event that makes the hyerlinks break. I've heard that sometimes hyperlinks can break due to excel crashing, and the file being saved from the recovery, however I'd say that it happens to us even without this occurrence.

We currently input hyperlinks by right clicking on the cell and choosing ""Link"" and following the prompt. I am wondering if there is a different way to hyperlink, or if there's a way to prevent the hyperlinks from changing from their current location to appdata/roaming?"
excel,Searching across multiple sheets to return a cell value based on a unique ID,"I'm working on a caseload tracker for a supervisor here at work. The idea is that there is a shared workbook containing 11 tabs/sheets... 1 sheet is the supervisor's summary sheet, and the other 10 are the individual team members' sheets.

The supervisor enters each case onto the summary/supervisor sheet, assigns it a unique ID, and assigns it to a team member. That info then gets sent to their individual sheets, providing them with their caseload (this part I have covered).

Then, the team member has information that they need to enter about the case (status, comments, dates, etc.). I need THAT information to populate back onto the supervisor's sheet, based on the assigned unique ID. Basically I'm needing excel to search across multiple tabs/sheets to return the value of a particular cell, based on the unique ID.

After doing some research, it looks like I need to use Index/Match/Indirect to accomplish this, but I can't seem to get the formula right.

I have it figured out for one individual sheet: =(INDEX(AR!Q:Q,(MATCH(A2,AR!A:A,0))))
A2 is the location of the ID #
""AR"" is the team member's sheet
column Q is where the information I need returned is stored

I'm just not sure how to re-write this with the Indirect function.

Any help is GREATLY appreciated!"

excel,Using Named Cells in Excel Workbook to Audit All Those Excel Workbooks in PowerQuery,"**Each Workbook**

There is a very well structured, perfectly identical series of Excel workbooks that have named ranges and cells throughout... t\_XXXX for this table or v\_XXXX for that variable/cell.  When using Power Query, naturally, all of them are visible and viewable.

**Location**

They are stored on a hard-drive--nothing complicated.  Power Query for ""Get from Folder"" brings up the file information all in a table like it is supposed to including Source file name, extension, date created, Binaries, etc.  All like we'd expect.

**Trying to Do**

Power Query for a simple table that shows ANY of that file/source information--so, let's say File Name and File Path, just those two columns (which the others can be removed as a step easily, I have that) AND show in another column the value from one of those variables/cells.  Let's say there is a ""v\_version"" named range in there and it has the workbook version code in it.  Some of these workbooks might have code ""BXX"" in v\_version and some might have code ""CXX"".  Seeing File Name, Path, and (custom column) Version in one table.

In theory this would be best if I can show more than one of those variables/cells.  Say, v\_version in the third column and it's value from it's workbook; but v\_person in another column next to it.

**Tricky Issue I Had**

When trying to do it with ""expand binaries"" or whatever, I have to pick ONE object in the Excel workbook(S).  I pick v\_version and I just end up with a one column table of versions (no source, no extension, no path, no context)."

excel,VLOOKUP and return complete row but with certain conditions,"Hi, I am new to the forum and I need some help please :)

I have several rows where a specific Event ID (Column A) occurs multiple times. What I want to do is have all the key information on just 1 row without having the Event ID being displayed on multiple rows.

As shown in the attached screenshot, in column P, I have for removed the duplicates for each of the IDs and in cell Q2 I have used the formula **=VLOOKUP($P2,$A$2:$L$38,COLUMN(B1),FALSE)** and dragged across + down to populate/create an additional table which I will be working on. Based on the highlighted cell, only the Event ID which is being looked up within column P and the ""COLUMN"" lookup changes, e.g, **COLUMN(B1),** **COLUMN(C1),** **COLUMN(D1)**.

This additional table appears to partially return what I am looking for. However, I need a formula to return the following on a single row for a specific Event ID:

1. Based from the Date column (Column C) I want to return the **earliest** date shown of a specific ID within the additional table created on the right. For example Event ID 211680 has dates 01/10/2018, 02/10/2018 and 03/10/2018 across multiple rows. I just want 01/10/2018 to be returned as it's the earliest date. However, with my formula it is incorrectly returning the date 02/10/2018, as shown in my attached image (cell R5). What formula do I use to ensure it's looking for the **earlier date** for a specific Event ID?
2. From the IR Code column (Column L) I want to return the IR code for a specific Event ID in terms of ""priority"" being shown in the following order: LOM, DAM2, DAM1, AOG, 41, 43. So for example, if in any of the rows for a specific Event ID, ""LOM"" does not appear, then it looks to return ""DAM2"", if that does not appear in any of the rows for a specific Event ID and DAM1 does, then ""DAM1"" is returned, as it's the highest priority code being shown. As shown with Event ID, it is returning the IR Code ""41"" (cell AA5), however, I want it to return ""AOG"" as it's the highest priority code. It appears my formula is only returning the values found within the first row of a specific Event ID. What can I do to ensure it returns the highest possible IR code? (Tried to explain this as simple as possible!)
3. From the additional table I have created, the formula I have used returns all the columns, however, I only want to return specific columns. I want to return columns: B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L and M. I have tried just deleting the columns from the additional table created but then it ruins the whole table and returns incorrect values.

I would appreciate it if anyone could help me out please and I am willing to clarify anything that is unclear! :)

excel,Selecting random rows and highlighting them.,"I am fairly new to VBA and need help selecting random rows and highlighting them. This is for randomly selecting parts and performing quality checks.

I have a worksheet that can vary in length. I know where the first row will start so i set that then find the last row of data and set that row. I use RandBetween these values to generate a random row. It has been requested that I generate and highlight about 1 in 5 rows or 20% (it doesn't have to be exact, they just want a handful of random rows). 

I think I should be looping through these values and subtract 5 from that to highlight again. There can be blank spaces in this worksheet that I don't want to highlight, I want to just regenerate the random row and highlight it. The same goes for rows that are already highlighted; I want to regenerate the random row.

I get close, but my loop doesn't continue; it just stops after one go around. Am I missing something in my loop or am I overthinking this and way out of touch?"

First post on this sub and I am seriously at my wit's end with this. So I have a series of unique IDs (over 5K with even more sub-entries for each ID) and my data is structured similarly to my screenshot. Essentially, I want to track the difference in days between the other entries (**within an ID**) and the purchase date **for that ID** (denoted by a ""Y"" in the purchase column). the ID always switches to the next after a purchase is made. For example in the first row for ID 1, 01-Jan is 24 days away from 25-Jan (the purchase date) and 02-Jan is 23 days away. The row afterwards starts ID 2 and shows that 01-Jan is 247 days away from 04-Sept which is that ID's purchase date.

I want my output to look like the red coloured column. My excel knowledge is Intermediate tier-ish but I can overlook basic things so I apologize if the answer is obvious. I know how to obtain the difference of dates between two cells but I dont know how to obtain them for something based on the change of ID.

excel,Power Query removing duplicates problem,"Hello, I have spent 3 hours trying to make a dimension table for my power query. Essentially this is what I have, I have 2 queries right now. 1. Is a query pulling a list of serial numbers from a folder with csv reports that contain how many serial numbers are active by month for the last 2 years. Basically how many serial numbers were active each month for the last 2 years. This report, has thousands of serial numbers that are not my companies. 

My second query, is my list of total serial numbers company wide. This is also pulling from a folder with 2 years of month by month reports. This list is larger than query 1 because I am trying to compare how many serial numbers were “active” compared to how many serial numbers I have total in the company. I need this because report 1 has some serial numbers that are “on contract” and others that are not on contract. I want to be able to see how many of the serial numbers in the first report, were on contract, that specific month based on the second report. 

I’ve got both queries set up exactly how I like, however, I am struggling to create relationships between the total serial numbers query and the total active serial numbers. 

My first solution, was to make a dimension table. I did this by taking the total serial numbers report copying it, and then hitting “remove duplicates.” I thought this would make me a list of unique value, however it did not. Whenever I try to connect the dimension table serial number list with the two other queries  it gave me a columns must be unique error. I looked and looked and looked, and finally just loaded the query into excel and when I did conditional formatting on duplicate values sure enough there were 5 serial numbers that were duplicated. Weird? Why didn’t power query delete those? I went into the power query and started adding steps to play with the formatting like making them all text and making it all upper case, that got rid of 2 of the duplicates but there were still more. Why isn’t power query removing the duplicates completely in my dimension table???

I’m at a loss. I have no idea how to do this. I just need to know whether the machine in report 1 was in that specific months report 2. I may be approaching this completely wrong, but I really need help. I don’t want to waste any more time at work dealing with this lol. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.

I have a schedule that fluctuates day by day and I am trying to use vba to take the data from this master list and breakdown into individual driver pay. Drivers switch routes, cover, etc very frequently, so as the day goes on I just input the driver on the route. Then to the right I have a countif * pay function of each route for each driver.

I started a macro that loops for each driver in the list and creates their own sheet and I am trying to tie in itemized pay for each driver on their own sheet.

For example, Route 1 is covered by Driver 1 five days during this week and driver 1 covers route 5 as well. So I am trying to build something into vba that would record on a new sheet for driver 1 something like
1/13/20 route 1 $100 
1/14/20 route 1 $100 
1/15/20 route 1 $100 
1/16/20 route 1 $100 
1/17/20 route 1 $100 
1/14/20 route 5 $75

excel,"MATCH formula not working when searching by summed value, but it works when i type the value in by hand","I am absolutely stumped here.  My formula is 
=index([workbook1.xslx]sheet1!$A:$I, match(g44, [workbook1.xslx]sheet1!$D:$D, 0), 1)

G44 is the value the match formula is searching workbook 1 with, and it is a sum of a column of numbers.  When G44 contains the sum formula, the match (and thus the whole formula) returns a #N/A error.  When i type in the sum by hand in cell G44, say 800.58, the match formula works and it returns the correct data.

Delete columns b,c,d,g&amp;h

I currently have figured out how many heads I need by hour based on work, using average handle time and items that need to be completed, but it would be much better if I could roll unfinished items into the next half hour rather than being overstaffed for random hours.

excel,A Formula for Route Building,"Hello!

I need to make a formula to make my life a little easier. I will do my best to explain what I need:

I have a list of routes on one sheet, for example:

Aaaa-Bbbb,

Aaaa-Cccc,

Aaaa-Eeee

I have about 20-25 unique routes, I would like to assign them all a value. Every day I get a spreadsheet from a customer that provides me with what routes are going that day. The routes never change but I will only have certain ones on certain days.

I would like to be able to simply type in the route number (That I need to assign, not sure how to do that) in cells and run a macro(?) that then populates the sheet with the routes I have selected so that I may copy and paste them in order to another spreadsheet where we track them.

For example if the customer sends me routes 1,2,4,7,8,10,12 I would like to be able to type just the numbers into a cell, have it pull the route details and auto populate the cells in which the single digits were typed. I hope that makes sense.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks"

excel,Page setup when sending from array to print preview," 

Hi Guys

   I would like some assistance with this problem please. I am a novice with VBA, so please try to keep it simple if you can.

I have a List box (ListboxSh) on sheet ""Home"", populated by a series of 'If' statements. (This part works fine.)

I then call a User form""PrintOptions"" which holds some check boxes and  3 cmd. buttons, Customers, Admin, and Site. command buttons are coded as below to choose selected sheets from the list box and send them either to 'Print Preview or straight to print.  (All this up to here works fine.)

This is the problem, each set of sheets is made up of the same sheets but  is formatted differently. i.e. set1 i may be Portrait, Fit to pages wide 1 and zoom 80. it may have columns A to E Hidden =False, Whereas the sheets in set 2, although being the same sheets may be Landscape,Fit to pages wide 1 and Zoom 100. I may also like to Unhide some colums and maybe add some other page setup items.

The code below is what I am doing to get the selected sheets from my list box to my print preview / print screen.

**My Question** is what code do I need to implement the page setup changes and where in the code do I insert the new code. Please bear in mind that I may need to go backwards and forwards between the three sets of sheets.

I realise that hide/unhide columns and the page setup can be carried out manually, but i want to do it all by coding.

i'm essentially trying to use each bar as an unrolled pie graph, but all along the same scale. bonus points if you know how to remove the legend and have the titles *on* the blocks of colour. thanks!"

excel,Solved!!! Slow Excel File Opening/Excel Hang &amp; Not Responding,"I thought I'd pass along a solution to a problem my GF was having working with a crucial excel file for work. When opening the file, progress was slow and Excel would hang on 100% for several minutes and would become unresponsive much of the time. After following all of the usual recommendations for file repair, Office reinstall, etc., etc., I searched various worksheets in the file and noticed that one must have had some sort of data in some ""far flung"" cell because the (sorry if this is the wrong terminology) ""slider box"" along the right side of the screen was very small and moved very slowly as one scrolled down the worksheet with the arrow keys. This in effect made the file size huge. Rather than find the offending cells, I simply copied the desired ones and pasted them into a new sheet, and then deleted the old sheet. BOOM, problem solved. File size dropped from 6,900 KB to 970KB and now loads, saves and generally operates properly.  


To tell the complete truth, the situation was even worse at first — she had duplicated the problematic sheet, so the file size was over 12,000KB. Once I deleted the duplicate sheet and saw the file size drop by almost half, I knew the culprit had to be in the sheet that was duplicated.

For example, on the left side of the page there is the full column of names. Because of the length of the column, the data is printing across two pages. Is there a way to have the content of the second page reflow onto the right side of the first page, so that all data can be seen in 2 columns on the first page?

I realize this is probably impossible, but my boss is asking. I appreciate any help!

excel,Excel Scoring Multiple Criteria Methodology - Is This Mathematically OK?,"I'm trying to find the 'worst 10' of 40 or so organisations by three fairly arbitrarily selected sets of performance data. All this data is very different, but I'm happy to consider each of equal importance in the final score (some is a % rate, other data is just a value, but in all cases big=bad). 

My current plan is to score them like this: =D3/MAX(D:D) meaning that the highest value will always score 1 (or 100%), while the other values' scores will be determined by their relationship to the highest score. I will then average each organisation's score across these three scores to determine their total score. 

Are there any major hangups about scoring this way? I have been thinking that maybe, given I'm scoring all 40 organisations of this type that exist, then the MIN of their values should = 0, when now it just 34% or whatever, but I'm unsure how to do this or whether it's important!

Any help, reassurance, or alternatives would be very welcome!"
excel,Pivot Table Ignoring 2020 Date Data,"Hi Everyone, 

I've been running a pivot table to analyze my business for over a year, and recently ran into a nasty issue when the year became 2020. 

When I copy and paste my data from 2020, my pivot table no longer recognizes the data from 2020, but still captures everything with ""2019"" and ""2018"" Example: 1/1/2020  data = not recognized. 12/1/2019 = is recognized. 

The weird thing is when I click ""change source data"" and update it to include the added 2020 data, the dashed line that indicates where the pivot table stops looking at the data is right at the end of 2019, no matter how many times I tell it to look at the entire data set. 

I'm using slicers to tie 2 tables together, so I can view brands and sub brands separately. Not sure if that matters, but I figured I would include it for clarity. 

Any ideas on how to fix this issue so my meeting doesn't end with me looking like I need to call Microsoft? Thanks!"

excel,I want to make graph where I can see total sum of the downtime contributed by each machine in a given period of time.,"I am a mechanical engineer in manufacturing. I would like to find what machine breaks down the most frequently and how much down time that machine contributes to production flow in a given time. Luckily, our maintenance team enters every down time event in our database, stating the machine name, event time, down time minutes caused, the reason for failure etc. I have access to this massive raw database. As you imagine every machine name appears more than multiple times, as well as cause of the failure. I want to make graph where I can see total sum of the downtime contributed by each machine in a given period of time. Being new to advanced excel functions, I don't know what functions I would need. So I would probably need a second sheet that looks at the machine name column and copies each machine name only once, and doesn't duplicate. The next column would be total down time from that machine. For example, this would be one graph. What other things can I do ? How do I make sure my graphs will get updated, when I  replace the database with updated info after a couple of months?"
excel,Sorting/filtering issues tied to button,"Hey guys - 2nd post in 2 days. Sorry to spam; bare with me!

I've created an excel document that tabulates all of my school activity information by due date/time/type(exam/quiz/assignment) etc. I would like to create a series of buttons that will allow me to sort and view the data in very specific ways - I wish I could post a screenshot, but I guess I'll just try and explain. I'm having a few issues

What I want: I'd like to create several macro buttons for sorting 1.) All activities in chronological order;  2.) All exams/quizzes in chronological order displayed intermixed. 3.) All activities in chronological order by class type.

Proposed Strategy: Record a macro for a custom sort of desired types in desired orders then link to shape button.

Issues:

1.)~~For exam/quiz view displayed intermixed - right now when I do I custom sort by type then date, the Quizzes show up down the list from Exams A-Z. Perhaps I have to use some combination of filter and sort tied to the button - the problem is, filtering hides data, and I don't want to hide anything. I almost want ""Exam"" and ""Quiz"" to be viewed as the same thing - but only for this view, not for all activities sorted chronologically.~~

2). Some of the cells in my date column are text (""TBD"" and ""Revolving"") - sorting puts these fields at the bottom of the list, I'd like them to appear on top (when sorting from oldest to newest).

Any advice?

Thanks guys

Edit: Also if any new data is added, then I'm assuming my buttons break...is there anyway for the chosen sort field to extend past my data range, or otherwise update automatically? I don't want to have to recreate the macro every time something gets added.

Edit - Just gonna use some if statements in a hidden column that pool Exams/quizzes into an ""in-class assessment category"" and then sort on that; and then TBD/Revolving assigned a date from 1800s in hidden column using IF."
excel,Run-time error 1004 You can’t change part of an array.,"  

Dear Sir / Madam,

I calculate some values in Spreadsheet A of a Workbook and copy the values only to spreadsheet B in the same workbook using a macro. On the second or subsequent time in which I use the macro to place the newer data in the same location in spreadsheet B by deleting some cells in rows and columns to the left of where the current data is to be stored the macro immediately shows a run-time error. The cells being removed are blank cells with no formulas or values or formatting. The first time I run the macro it works. Upon running it the second time it immediately opens a message which states “Run-time error 1004 You can’t change part of an array”.

I am running the Excel spreadsheet on Windows 10, Excel 2016.

None of the following work to solve the problem:

I cannot find any GWXL97.DLA file;

Edit Copy and Edit Paste of the highlighted cells into the same location as the cells to be deleted;

Changing the macro to a different group of unformatted empty cells to remove produces the same error message;

The trust settings for macros in Excel are open and macros enabled;

Find &amp; Select, Go to Special and Current Array says that no cells are found;

Home and Clear Button, Clear Formats has no effect;

F2, CTRL +X, select new location CTRL +V, CTRL+Shift + enter have no effect.

Following is the initial code section text where the problem occurs:

Application.Goto Reference:=""R5C2""

Range(""B5:X130"").Select

Selection.Delete Shift:=xlToLeft

Application.Goto Reference:=""R5C1543""

Range(""BGI5:BHI130"").Select

Selection.Insert Shift:=xlToRight, CopyOrigin:=xlFormatFromLeftOrAbove

Application.Goto Reference:=""Model!R\[-2\]C\[-1538\]""

How do I remove the error message or simply bypass it as it has no meaning or use?

Many thanks in advance for your assistance.

Best Regards,

excel,"Asset weights in portfolio, minimizing variance, maximizing return. (Solver)","Good afternoon,

So I am calculating portfolio weights in a multi asset portfolio, trying to minimize portfolio variance (calculated through =mmult and covariance matrix)  in daily returns. Right now I am using Solver with the objective of minimizing variance and Rule that asset weights should add up to 1. As far as I understand, right now Solver is giving me the weights for assets that would give me the lowest overall variance and a given expected return at those weights. My question is, is it possible to adjust Solver or some other formula that would generate asset weights as to give me the best ratio of return/variance (not necessarily have the lowest possible variance, but the best risk/reward so to say). 

This is how the spreadsheet looks right now.

excel,Searching up multiple lists and then displaying them as individual lines,"Hi all, 

was hoping for some help with a work excel

The final output I'm looking for is a list of subitems listed in individual columns and no blank columns   

visual example: https://imgur.com/a/lMpbkup

&amp;nbsp;

Example (| is a column separator)

Order 1 | sub-cat1 | subcat-2 | subcat-3|  

&amp;nbsp;

The way you get sub-cats are that each category a customer purchases is linked to multiple subcats

&amp;nbsp;

example:

&amp;nbsp;

category 1 = sub-cat 1, sub-cat 2, subcat-3

category 2 = sub-cat 2, sub-cat 5

category 3 = sub-cat 6  

&amp;nbsp;

An order is inputted into the excel with order number and the categories

&amp;nbsp;
  
Example: 

Order 1 | Cat-2 | Cat-3

&amp;nbsp;

and I would like to transform that into  

&amp;nbsp;

Order 1 | subcat-2 | subcat-5 | subcat-6

&amp;nbsp;

I hope that helps explain it.


&amp;nbsp;

What I've tried to do so far and I'm able to do is to use vlookup and find the corresponding subcats which are related to the cats. What I can't do is to place the cats into individual columns. The reason is that each cat has a different amount of subcats - I find that I don't know how many columns a category needs in order to display all of its subcats. If I allocate too many columns then I have a lot of blank columns that I can't have on the sheet."
excel,Index(Match columns based on header title?,"I am making a spreadsheet that requires you to dump a query from our ERP system into its designated tab. There are 2 or 3 columns I'd like to return on another tab.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd Index the specific column that has the values I want to return, with a Match function for a specific array column I'm matching it too... simple.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the query/dashboard within our ERP system allows users to change the column order. Obviously now someone's import of the query may not match my Index and Match Array columns in my function.

&amp;#x200B;

My Spreadsheet Headers:

Ex: Date|Price|Description|QTY|Order#

(I'm indexing ""Price"", and my Match Array is ""Description"" (we'll call it Index($B:$B) and Match(sheet1,$C:$C,0) (ignore sheet1, I just used that to keep the formula consistent with Excel, for this example focus on Column B&amp;C.

&amp;#x200B;

Coworkers Headers:

Ex: Description|QTY|Price|Date|Order#

Now my coworker has organized their columns differently, and now my formula would end up indexing ""QTY"" and the match array would capture ""Price"". This is obviously not the intent of how I set up the function.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question: Is there a way (without coding) that I can Index(Match( by searching for the name of the column header rather than creating an absolute value such as $B:$B &amp; $C:$C. My coworkers would then be able to have any order they want, but my Index command would search for ""Price"" and my Match command would search for ""Description"". Ultimately pulling the correct column rather it is column B or Column C (coworker example).

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the lengthy post, I just wanted to paint the picture vividly. Please let me know if I'm making sense and if there is anyway to create a function for my question.

The original template links all income, expenses, and savings to an activity table where he inputs each individual expenditure, which card it's on, and what category it fits into from a drop down menu and it links to his budget table automatically. He also had his budget linked to a graph to show how it changed over time but I am not using that.

I only use one card, so I deleted that section from the template, and I also condensed the savings section, which is also not linked to a drop down menu. I tried to kind of just copy what the original author had in his template as well as the formulas that I used for the expenses, but that didn't work, and I couldn't really find anything online either.

excel,Most efficient way to filter table to multiple criteria.,"(The title of my original post was terrible, and I couldn't figure out how to edit. Sorry.)

I have a table (general ledger) of thousands of rows. If I want to filter to a single account number, that's easy. Sometimes I want to filter to 4 or 5 account numbers, and it's frustrating to select the accounts I want from a table drop-down with hundreds of accounts. I've come up with a solution...

In A1 - A5 I can type 1 to 5 account numbers I care about.

The table runs from A6:L10505 (row 6 is headers). In a column I added to the end, I want a formula that will return ""FILTER"" if the GL Account Number for that row of the table matches **any** of the numbers I typed into A1:A5. Then I just filter the table on the Filter column and suddenly I'm only looking at the 2-5 account numbers I care about.

My two solutions so far are below. I'm wondering **which will take more processing power and slow my computer down the most**, AND if there is a **more elegant way** to quickly do this. I'm NOT interested in a pivot table (for reasons that aren't worth explaining here).

(The GL accounts are stored as text, so each is multiplied by 1 to match to the A1:A5 list.)

Solution 1:

=IF(OR(\[@Account\]\*1=$A$1,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$2,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$3,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$4,\[@Account\]\*1=$A$5),""FILTER"","""")

excel,Implicit intersection operator (@) breaks array functions,"I opened a spreadsheet today and found several array functions have been corrupted by an implicit intersection operator (@). There was a popup that tried to explain what the operator is intended for so it seem this is a new feature.

I had to manually find and delete all of the automatically inserted @ and use the Ctrl+shift+enter entry method to obtain proper results. 

Has anyone else noticed this behavior? Is it a bug? This is going to be a huge problem for me if I have to update all array functions in every spreadsheet I open.

Edit: More details:

The formula was:

    {=PRODUCT(range + 1)\^(12/count(range)) - 1}

It was converted to:

    =PRODUCT(@range + 1)\^(12/count(range)) - 1

This returned a different value from the previous formula. This only occurred in a single workbook. I have not been able to replicate in any other workbooks that contain the same formula or other array formulas.

excel,How to make a logic check repeat on a different row if failed on the current one?,"I asked this question yesterday, and it got removed because my title wasn't correct. I hope it is now, and if not, if the mods could please suggest one they'd be okay with.

I have a sheet where I track an amount of films and ranks that go with it.  Here is the sheet: [https://imgur.com/a/sqNKaSf](https://imgur.com/a/sqNKaSf) 

B12 is the cell I need to solve. It needs to check whether D19 is is greater than 0. If it is, it needs to return B19. If not, it needs to do the same check on D18. If not again, D17 and so on until it finds a value greater than 0. Right now I have a code that works but it's massively messy. Currently the formula is:

 =IF(D12&lt;=0.009,B12,IF(D13&lt;=0.009,B13,IF(D14&lt;=0.009,B14,IF(D15&lt;=0.009,B15,IF(D16&lt;=0.009,B16,IF(D17&lt;=0,B17,B18)))))) 

It works but it's hardly a good formula. Any way I could optimize it? I got suggested INDEX but that doesn't appear to work. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but it always returns N/B.

So then since it was found in column D then I would want it to return a value from J. The corresponding value in J10 is in this case -2.

Then in cell C44 I would like it to look for the 2nd occurrence of Argentina in columns B and D. This happens in D19. Thus I would like the result in J19 which is 3.

Here's the codes I have found below, but have been giving me issues:

This code is when I go straight to VBA and try to relate it to the textbox specifically:

Select Case Textbox1.Value

Case ""A"":Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(255, 0, 0)

Case ""B"": Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(0, 255, 0)

Case ""C"": Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 255)

Case Else"" Textbox1.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 0)

End Select

End Sub

This one gives me the object error.

This is the code where I go to the textbox and assign a macro to it:

Private Sub AutoShape3\_change()

Select Case Autoshape3.Value

Case ""A"": AutoShape3.BackColor = RGB(255, 0, 0)

Case ""B"": AutoShape3.BackColor = RGB(0, 255, 0)

Case ""C"": Autoshape3.BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 0)

excel,How can I avoid reapplying the same filter to a table?,"Maybe there's a better way to do this overall. I work for a small company and I'm new to excel so I'm not sure of the best way to do this, but this is what I have. 

Ultimate goal is to get each department their own personnel costs on one sheet.

Table 1 on sheet 1 - Budget table. This includes our personnel costs for each employee. 

Table 2 on sheet 2 - Distribution table. Each employee has different distribution of which department their personnel costs are coming from, but they'll always total 100%. It pulls name from the first table so as I add rows to Table 1, they carry over and I add the new employee's distribution. 

Table 3 on sheet 3 - Administration department.  The list of employees who have some or all of their costs allocated to this department. I have formulas so that it pulls from the other tables * their distribution for this department. I then filtered the table so that it includes staff who's distribution is not 0%. 

This works great until I add a row to the first table or change the distribution so that another employee now has some % in administration or has their % removed. I have to reapply my filter to the table. 

I plan on having more sheets for each department to have their own personnel costs table. How can I do this so that I don't have to have the filters re-selected on each table every time adjustments are made to Tables 1 or 2?

Below is the formula that is currently working, with a static range in the first reference of the Query ($A$2:$AO$11)

=QUERY('External Tab'!$A$2:$AO$11,""SELECT ""&amp;SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,MATCH(""Account"" ,'External Tab'!$A$2:$AO$2,0),4),1,""""))

Ideally, I would be able to have the '11' value dynamically change, based on the number of rows that contain either 'Live' or 'Pending' in the rows. That way, when the query is pulled, it returns a specific number of rows. As it stands now, if the table it is referencing is longer than 11 rows it will not pull in all of the data. I can't put an arbitrarily large number in there to account for this, as the query will then start to pull in data further down the worksheet that I don't want to see.

In trying to troubleshoot this, I am able to get the number of rows by using 2 COUNTIF formulas together:

=COUNTIF('External Tab'!A:AO,""Live"")+COUNTIF('External Tab'!A:AO,""Pending"")

In the above example, it returns a value of '10'. Ideally, this would dynamically make the range in the query **$A$2:$A:10** (instead of the static 11 it currently has)

Edit: this is in google sheets without access to script editor"

excel,Keeping column with formula blank until all conditions are met?,"Hi

I have a spreadsheet we use at the shelter I work with to keep track of all the cats, one of the things we keep track of is how long the cats were in the shelter before getting adopted.   
So we have a column with the date they entered (L), one with the date they leave (O) and then one with a formula that calculates the amount of days from that. (Q)

So for example, if we have a cat come in on 01/01/2020 (L2) and leaves 10/01/2020 (O2), we'll have =SUM(O2-L2)  in Q2 and it'll show 10.

How can I put the formula in Q but keep it empty and only show the amount of days when we fill in the date in O column? Because if I put the formula in the entire column now, it shows -43846 until I fill out a date of departure.. 

Thanks for any help!"
excel,Find next available date to patch computer (patch Tuesday related),"I have a list of computers and need a way to auto schedule them. I need to find out when is the next available time based on a few factors. What I'm struggling with is how to handle all the variables.

Factors/Variables/restrictions:

1. A computer has a specific date and time it can be patched, see example below of how the schedule time table is set up. 
2. The environment has an overall Release calendar of dates and times that are allowed; can be found in another table
3. A 'group' of computers needs to be patched in order (This is identified by Group Column) 
4. If one fails or patching window is missed, it needs to push the dates of all other scheduled dates in its group respective of rules above
5. Release order goes A, then B, C , etc. (meaning I need to finish all A's in the group before I can do the B's).
6. Groups of computers can be done independently, meaning if group 1 finishes all A's it can proceed to B's, where as group 2 still is working on A's.
7. Patch opportunities happen at the start of every hour, and windows are every hour.
8. Patching takes a total of 5 hours, however if it's easier we can say it takes the entire day.

excel,How to find a cell value in table where column amount and order varies?," Hey there, hope you're all well!

I've been busy with VLOOKUP, MATCH and INDEX for many hours by now, but unfortunately I can't figure out this one.

I got generated report from our system, and it's headers amount/ordering changes once in a while, so I can't hard-code any columns into the formula I want to create.

In this example the only cell to be changed is K8

What I'm trying to achieve here is that when I change K8 value to ""BNI"" then the formula will go through all rows in the table and then locating one row which have:

* IF cell value on column, WHICH have header ""initials"", matches to K8 cell value
* AND IF cell value, WHICH have header ""relationship"", matches to string ""spouse""
* THEN return cell value from column, WHICH have header ""last name""

So in this example:

* when K8 is ""WBU"" then K11 value should be ""Beesly""
* when K8 is ""BNI"" then K11 value should be ""Martin""

Now, in case I'm overthinking this too much, then easier way might work as well, so the formula would go through all the rows, and if any of the cells have both K8 value and string ""spouse"" then it should return cell value of a column WHICH have header ""last name""

excel,Creating a UDF that indent cell automatically basing on the value of another cell,"Hello all,

I have been trying to write an auto-indentation UDF but so far it has been a head scratcher (given that I'm quite new to coding in general). For example, for the table below, how do I write a function in such a way that:

else if

""Item Level"" = 2 then add level 1 indent to ""Item Name""

Else

add level 2 indent to ""Item Name""

excel,Creating a Complex Report on Excel,"Hi, I'm trying to create a report form on excel. That is quite easy, right? Well, not. What I'm trying to do I don't know if its even possible, but maybe asking someone else could give me some hint.  
I was working on an access database that has a lot of different information regarding the productive process of different items. There are a lot of aspects here that are important, but for this particular report we are needing to use only four of them. The most important, and the one that it's related to the rest, it's the ""operative unit"". I have them all listed on tbl\_oper\_un. This table is linked to three juction tables: tbl\_join\_opun\_cqa  (that connects to tbl\_cqa a table that list critical quality aspects), tbl\_join\_opun\_provar (that connects to tbl\_proc\_var, which is a table that list the variables of the process) and to tbl\_join\_opun\_aep (that is also connected to tbl\_aep that list the associated experimental plans to check the operative units).  
I have linked all this tables to Excel, on different sheets.  
Now, this is like making a recipe: Not every recipe has the same amount of steps, and a lot of steps (or operative units) could be repited an indefinitely amount of times.   
What I was trying to do is this:  
\- Create a button that adds the amount of rows related to the amount of steps needed to complete te ""recipe"", that needs to have the same format.  
\- Select from a list the ""operative unit"" related to the step order of the recipe. Then all the others aspects would be linked to the ""operative unit"" and appear in the adjacent columns.  
\-Merge all the identical results from the distinct tables, so it's more organized and easy to view.

excel,How do I code a sum function for a coded survey with conditional branching questions?," 

Hey guys, I don't know a lot about excel so my question might be stupid or poorly phrased but I'll try my best.

So I have data from a survey. The survey has 14 questions. Each odd number question asks whether a person has difficulty performing a certain task. Answers to those question are either no (coded as 0), yes (coded as 1), or not applicable (cells left empty). If a person answered the odd number question with yes then they have to answer the even number question that followed it, which asked about the degree of difficulty. Answers to even number question were mild difficulty (coded as 1), moderate difficulty (coded as 2), severe difficulty (coded as 3), or unable to do the task (coded as 4).

each of the 7 question groups (that's what I will call an odd number question and the even number question that follows it) has a value of 4 (I'll try to explain). So if a person has no difficulty doing the task (i.e. answered the odd number question with no) they get 4 points. if they answer with yes then the score depends on their answer for the following even number question (mild=3, moderate=2,severe=1,unable to do it=0) (please bare in mind that these value are kind of the opposite of how the answers were coded). Ok so if one respondent answered all odd number questions with no they will get 4 points for each of the 7 question groups. I want that to be divided by the number of questioned he answered (in this case he answered all question groups so 4\*7=28, 28/7=4. So this respondents final score will be 4 (this means he has no difficulty at all performing any task). However, if this respondent found one question group not applicable (empty cell) and answered all the rest with no then I want to calculate the average for only the question groups he answered (6 in this case). I want the formula to recognize not to calculate empty odd number cells at all.

excel,How do I Paste with destination formatting with Undo capability.,"Hey I'm pasting often 40-100 times per day into an Excel spreadsheet, I'm using Windows 10 and running Excel 2016.

I've tried using Macros to be able to paste with the destination formatting however it prevents me from being able to Undo. I'm looking to be able to paste with the Undo capability. even if this involves an outside software.

I'm trying to set it to paste with the destination formatting using Ctrl+Shift+V, as excel doesn't even let me paste with that shortcut by default unlike word.I'm generally pasting numbers and random characters into tables I am open to using outside programs that'll run with excel only to allow me to paste and undo.

Edit:"" Press Alt E S, then you can choose either Values or Formulas based on what you’re wanting. ""Ctrl+Shift+V Worked after this. Thanks!"

excel,[VBA] Collection count smaller if item in loop is added after current item,"Hello,

There must definitely be something I'm missing or not fully understanding, but I've come across this weird issue while trying to write a function to generate some data for me.

I cannot post the entire function (since it contains private info), but this is the problem I have.

Just so it's easier to understand, these are the variables

Name | Typename
---|---
tcCol | **Collection**
tcItem(1,2,3) | **String**, part of the tcCol collection
regEx | Object - RegEx, with the **""\[.*?\]""** search pattern
tagLastColumn | **Long**
tagLastRow | **Long**
l, j, counter | **Long**


I have a collection (which already has some items), to which I'm adding more items in a loop. If I add the items to the end of the collection, the total collection size is almost 3 or 4 times bigger than if I was adding them after the current key.

    Debug.Print tcCol.Count
    
    For Each tcItem In tcCol
        If regEx.test(tcItem(2)) Then
            Set Matches = regEx.Execute(tcItem(2))
            For Each Match In Matches
                For j = 6 To tagLastColumn
                    If wksT.Cells(5, j) = Match And wksT.Cells(4, j) = vbNullString Then
                        For l = 6 To tagLastRow
                            If wksT.Cells(l, j).Value &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then
                                tcCol.Add Array(tcItem(0), tcItem(1), Replace(tcItem(2), wksT.Cells(5, j), wksT.Cells(l, j)))
                            End If
                        Next
                    End If
                Next
            Next
        End If
    Next
    
    Debug.Print tcCol.Count

This code returns **268 items before the for loop, and 2300 afterwards.**

However, if I do this, instead, the returned values are **268 items before the foor loop and 812 afterwards.**

    Debug.Print tcCol.Count
    
    counter = 1
    For Each tcItem In tcCol
        If regEx.test(tcItem(2)) Then
            Set Matches = regEx.Execute(tcItem(2))
            For Each Match In Matches
                For j = 6 To tagLastColumn
                    If wksT.Cells(5, j) = Match And wksT.Cells(4, j) = vbNullString Then
                        For l = 6 To tagLastRow
                            If wksT.Cells(l, j).Value &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then
                                tcCol.Add Array(tcItem(0), tcItem(1), Replace(tcItem(2), wksT.Cells(5, j), wksT.Cells(l, j))), , , counter
                                counter = counter + 1
                            End If
                        Next

                Next
            Next
        End If
    Next
    
    Debug.Print tcCol.Count    

I'm guessing that somehow, items added to the end of the collection are picked up as part of the for loop again and then replaced themselves, while those added at the current key do not, but I'm not totally sure.

Problem is that I need to add those items after the current key, not at the end of the collection.

Anyone got any idea of how to solve it?"
excel,Spreading the sum across cells,"Hello.

Hoping someone can help.

I have a calculation that produces a sum. What i would like to is split that sum over 6 cells with a maximum of 16.

So for example if the sum was less than 16 it would just display in 1st cell. If the sum is more than 16 the first cell would be 16 and the remainder in cell 2. If the sum was more than 32, cell 1 and 2 would both be 16 and the remainder in cell 3 and so forth if that makes sense.

What would you consider to be basic data analysis? I appreciate that pivot tables are good for data analysis but what else? I plan to show them simple dashboards, forecasting and basic Power Query. They're not able to do anything too advanced. Is there anything else I should consider?"

excel,Finding Sum Based Off of Variable,"So I'm pretty new at using formulas with Excel so I apologize if this is a fairly simple question to ask. I tried to research the sum function using other variables but have been unsuccessful in finding a solution. My issue is I have a spreadsheet where I am keeping track of items I need to order online, where I've ordered them, costs etc. On the next page to the right I have three sections for keeping running totals of Cost, Tax, Shipping Cost and Overall Total of the three. I have one section that is for everything on the sheet ordered or not ordered (that was easy to formula). The issue I am running into is I have a section for Ordered and Not Ordered where I would like to keep the same type of running totals. There is a field for each entry where it says ORDERED: and has either a Y or N as the value depending on whether I have ordered the item already. How to I create a formula that adds up the Cost, Shipping, Tax, and Total Cost but only if the ordered field is Y, or similarly N. So I can keep running totals based off of what has been ordered and what has not. I have included an image of the spreadsheet its probably easier to determine my question with it. I appreciate any help / advice, thanks.

I’m wondering if this is too much or something. I don’t want to look pretentious, but I also don’t want others to get credit for all the work I put into it, as I have to send it to two different upper management people to approve it, then they distribute it to their lower managers, then it gets distributed to the lower managers teams. 

Have any of you made excel projects for people in your job and put your name right out in the open? Am I thinking about this too much? Should I just leave my name in the Author line?

excel,Need assistance calculating a commission amount that changes based on the sale price.,"I have no idea if the way I wrote the title is correct, but this is generally what I need help with:

I'm a real estate agent and I need to figure out how to add a commission amount on excel, which for most deals is easy, just multiplying the sale by a certain percentage. However, for certain deals, I have a specific commission structure that changes based on the sale price, which is as follows.

For the first $250,000 of a sale price, the split is 50/50, for the next $250,000 the split is 60/40, and any amount above that is 70/30. Typical commission percentage from a sale is 2.5% of the sale price.

So, if I sell an $800,000 house, the first $250,000 of that is a 50/50 split, which comes out to $3,125. Then the next is 60/40 which is $3,750, and then the remaining $300,000 is calculated at 70/30 which is $5,250. Total is $12,125.

Now...how do I do that in excel? Any help would be super appreciated."

excel,"How to change a character in the following string ""00000""? (Can't use Replace()...)","Hello, I wasn't able to find a solution to this one and wanted to seek for help.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, Instead of creating 5 different Boolean variables for flag-checking purpose, i decided to get a little fancy and use one single string as a replacement to having those 5 variables.

Example below.

    Example 1:
    flag1 = false
    flag2 = false
    flag3 = false
    flag4 = false
    flag5 = false
    if True Then flag1 = True
    ' And repeat for other 4 flags...
    
    
    Example 2: What i want instead
    Dim smartFlag As String
    smartFlag = ""00000""
    If True Then smartFlag[0] = 1
    ' This above Example 2 won't work...

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to accomplish this? I saw Replace() function but i can't use this because of its required parameter for a character or sub-string to match against ""00000"".....

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I would like to keep this as a string ""00000"" format.

One other option i am trying to avoid is to convert the String variable to a Integer/Number variable and initially assigned it to 100000. Then afterward for each flag, it will just add 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1 respectively for each applicable flag

Other option is leaving it as a String but change the initial value to ""98765"" and for each applicable flag error, it updates the i-position string to 1 or 0. By leaving it to 98765, at least i can use Replace for identifying my intended index"

excel,Formatting Macros running slower than expected,"Hello!

I put together a spreadsheet which is running much more slowly then I expected. Ill describe the spread sheet and include the formula's and macro's used below. Just as a side note, I am dipping my toes into VBA and most of the macro was written with the record macro tool. Any help is appreciated!:

&amp;#x200B;

The spreadsheet mainly consists of a Named Table (Table1) which takes in data (Columns A:J) and two columns of formula's (columns K:L). I extended the table with the two formulas down 300 rows to account for most of our data pull sizes.

Column K formula Looks for a dollar amount within a string in a cell:

    =IF(F2 = """","""",MID(F2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789"")),FIND(""."",F2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789""))) - MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},F2&amp;""0123456789"")) +3))

&amp;#x200B;

Column J is an array formula searches a string (Sentence) within a cell with key words in a list (Named List) and returns any keyword it finds. The formula was returning 0 if it found nothing so I wrote an IF statement around it.

    =IF(IFERROR(INDEX(List,MATCH(FALSE,ISERROR(SEARCH(List,J2)),0)),"""") = 0,"""",IFERROR(INDEX(List,MATCH(FALSE,ISERROR(SEARCH(List,J2)),0)),""""))
    

I am unsure if there is a better way to implement these two formulas. Perhaps see if there is a way to write the second formula without it being an array? Maybe apply it only to Row 1 and have a macro paste it down to cover only the row size of the data as opposed to 300 rows? I am not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I have 2 macros assigned to buttons ""Format"" and ""Reset"". Format applies a distinct format while reset clears the pasted data (not the formulas).

Format Macro:

I wanted to add a custom sort but it made the macro take even longer to run through.

&amp;#x200B;

Reset: The formula I found to remove filters seems to really extend the duration of this macro. Its technically a for loop that unfilters every table in my worksheet even thought I only have the one table. I tried other formulas such as cells.ShowAllData but nothing else worked.

    Sub Reset()

excel,Function/Macro to Automated Repetitive Tasks," Hi everyone,

I'm trying to automate a certain repetitive and manual task and I'm seeking some advice. I have to do this in approximately 100 CSV files.

1. The CSV files have a series of data, many of which is unwanted and requires deletion. The first item on the agenda is to delete all of the rows except for the ones with given keywords specified in Column A (in my case, there will be 2). For eg, if we have 100 rows, and in column A there are various record named called ""keyworda, keywordb, keywordc, keywordd, keyworde"". I want to specify and delete all rows which do not contain ""keyworda"" and ""keywordb"" in any of the rows under Column A.
2. Once Step 1 is done, the next item is to clean up unwanted Columns. For eg, delete Column C, Em H, I, K.

Does anyone know of any functions or macros which can help me automate the above to speed things up?

Thanks"

excel,RIGHT formula not pulling First name correctly?,"I have a sheet with a column that lists first and last names together. I asked a similar question last week but the requirements have changed and the formulas I found don't work like I thought they would.

    Smith,John
    Thompson,Jack J

And so on.

For a variety of reason I'm not using Text to Columns for this template and want a formula to separate the two sides with comma. For the left side I have the formula below and it works perfectly.

    =LEFT(A2,FIND("","",A2)-1)

For the right side I use

    =RIGHT(A2,FIND("","",A2)+1)

This works sometimes, but other times it doesn't and I have no idea why. For example if I have John Smith, this works perfectly. But if I have Scott,Michael A then the first two letters get cut off. I'm assuming because of the space and Middle Initial. Despite having the formula only look for the "","" why would it be affected by this?"
excel,Removing corrupt custom styles,"I have recently started a job which requires me to work with and roll forward spreadsheets which have many (approx. 30,000) custom styles.

    Sub StyleKiller()

        Dim inSc, ninSc As Boolean
        Dim a As Integer
        a = 0

            N = .Styles.Count
            inSc = True
            For i = N To 1 Step -1

When I try to delete them manually nothing happens, and if I try to apply the style I get an error saying “Style ‘name’ not found” so I assume they’re corrupted.

I’ve done some googling and a few forums have suggested changing the extension to .zip, deleting parts of the style.xml file, then converting back to an xlsx. Whilst this works it also removes all formatting from the spreadsheet. There are upwards of 50 sheets in each workbook so going through and reformatting them isn’t really an option.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to delete these customs styles without using the .zip method?"

excel,Model that weights SG in PGA &amp; European Tour Golf by the field's strength," Has anyone made a model that weights SG (shots gained) against the field weighted by the strength of each field?

I've categorised fields into 1 of 5;

\- Majors

\- Category 1 (strongest field outside of majors)

\- Cat 2

\- Cat 3

\- Cat 4

\- Cat 5 (weakest fields on either Euro/PGA Tour, i.e. none of the OWGR top 50, predominantly ranked 200-500).

I'm working out shots gained against the field in each event, then adjusting the standard scratch in each event, dependent on the strength of each field. I'm wondering how heavily I should weight this. I know Josh Culp/Numberball do this very well for those aware.

For example; Adam Scott won the AUS PGA with a total SG against the field of **15.97, averaging 3.99** per round.

I've categorised this as a CAT 3 event, with a fairly weak field.

This adjusts the SG against field for all players (i.e adjusting the Standard Scratch).Adam Scott's changes to the following using this formula:

**Total : 11.11**

**Average: 2.87**

Examples of other categories would be:

MAJORS - N/A

**CAT 1 (RAW SG/1.006) - Total: 14.42, AV: 3.56**

**CAT 2  (RAW SG/1.011) - Total: 12.81, AV: 3.20**

**CAT 3  (RAW SG/1.017) - Total: 11.11, AV: 2.87**

**CAT 4 (RAW SG/1.022) - Total: 9.71, AV: 2.43**

\--

All players are adjusted accordingly using this structure. Has anyone done anything similar or have suggestions? Do you think this either weighted enough, or not enough? Would be good to collaborate on ideas."
excel,How can I track a changing cell value over time and plot the changes automatically to a chart?,"It sounds simple but I have tried to google this and all solutions always use static data as input. 

I have an excel file (lets call it file A) with only one sheet and on it only a single cell with data in it (a number in the cell). The most simple excel file you can have. One sheet, one cell with a value. But the value automatically changes over time dependent on another excel file (file B). Right now the number is 10. The number however is not static data but is populated by reading from another excel file (file B) by using a simple COUNT function. The number is how many rows in file B on a specific column contain data - are not empty. So the function in the cell of file A is the following:

=COUNT('[file B.xlsx]Sheet1'!F:F)

where ""Sheet1"" is the sheet in the file B that contains a couple of rows with data. 

Sometimes, the number of rows with data in file B changes, so the number in the cell in file A will sometimes be 10, sometimes 8, sometimes 12, and whatever else depending on how many rows in file B contain data at a particular point in time. That means the number in the file A will vary depending on how many rows have data in them in the column F in file B.

*This is what I want to do: track the changes of this cell and show it on a graph.* For example, the value in the cell in file A is now 10 because the F column in file B contains only 10 cells with data, the rest are empty. If I go into file B and either remove or add a row with data in column F, the number in file A will increase or decrease, and that change should be tracked and displayed on a graph where the y axis is the number and x is time set to update each second, minute, hour or day and the charts x axis is going on into the future.

In the end, if I go in to file B that has 10 rows and add 5 rows within a minute, a chart should be updated that displays that first the value in file A was 10 and then next minute the value was 15. This should plot a line graph so if after a day the cell value always increased, the line is constantly going up and each step on the x axis is a minute, an hour or a day.

Perhaps I am over thinking it and this is easier than I think, but when I google this I get either examples using static time and value data - ie two columns that have static months and values each months, for example. Or people say ""this is easily built in to excel"" or ""you have to do this completely crazy vba script"". I cant think its that hard tracking and displaying cell values changes over time. Its simply plotting a graph from a cell which has a value that changes. It doesnt even have to be a cell that reads from another file either, you might as well have a cell with a static number, and if you manually change that number, the line chart updates with a new value and over time shows what different values the cell had minutes, hours, days or even months ago.

TLDR: I want to plot the value changes of a cell to a line chart automatically as time passes. Something like ""plot cell data changes automatically to a chart every minute""

Any ideas how to achieve this? It feels like basic Excel yet after days I still can't figure out how to even start since I don't have static data as input."

excel,Substitute Multiple Text Values in Cascading List,"I have a cascading list and the first level has titles that originally contain either a ""/"" or a "" "".

Once a person checks out i need to copy that name over with the check in and check out dates to another sheet for billing. Each person checks in and out on random dates, there is no connection to when they will check out with the room partners.

What I'd like to add is the ability to automatically fill the time (Column A) when i make a new entry. For example, when I add a new item name in column B, the time in column A will automatically be created based on the time its entered.

From here, I'd like to be able to create a function that alerts me as soon as 4 hours have passed. The reason being that items have certain buy limits every 4 hours. In B1696 for example, the 'Mazcab Ability Codex' can only be purchased 2 times every 4 hours.

I made a post last year similar to this and was told I can do this using VBA worksheet with the following code:

    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)     If Not Intersect(Target, Range(""A:A"")) Is Nothing Then         Dim time As Date         time = Target.Value         newTime = time + TimeValue(""00:00:05"")         Application.OnTime newTime, ""alert""     End If End Sub 

And this code inside a VBA module:

    Sub alert()     MsgBox ""4 hours that you bought an item"" End Sub
    
    I'll be honest. I have never used VBA before and was somewhat confused by this so any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

excel,"Challenge - Create a list of values from 1 to 100, set multiples of 3 to display as Duck, set multiples of 5 to display as Goose and multiples of both 3 and 5 as DuckGoose."," After 3 hours of trying different things, including my very first attempt at any kind of macros, I had very little to show for my attempt at this challenge.

My initial approach was to select the 1-99 list and use conditional formatting rules to highlight first multiples of 3 in red, then multiples of 5 in blue, and then multiples of 15 (3x5) in orange.

A sample conditional formatting formula used to highlight multiples of 3 was =MOD(A1,$M$3)=0, which looked at the list and divided each by cell M3, in which I had entered the number 3. I used similar formulas for 5 and 15.

My plan was then to use the Find and Replace feature to find cells with red formatting and replace them with 'Duck', blue cells with 'Goose' and orange with 'DuckGoose'. However, AFAIK Excel cannot use conditional formatting as a recognised formatting type to perform Find and Replace. Dead End.

I then typed 'Duck', 'Goose' and 'DuckGoose' in three separate cells. Then cntrl+c on 'Duck', and cntrl+click on every (red) multiple of 3, cntrl+v, which pasted 'Duck' into these cells. Then the same for Goose on blue cells, and DuckGoose on orange cells, which took &lt; 1 minute.

excel,Using EXCEL to convert between different types of names,"I'm a Biologist (lower end of experience with excel - just learned to use VLOOKUP the other day) stuck on a bit of a naming problem. One of my datasets spat out 15,000 cells of data, but with a useless naming scheme for the proteins. It used a protein accession name, whereas I want a gene name.

Background, every gene has multiple names. For example BRCA2 is the gene name (causes breast cancer when mutated), whereas ENSG00000139618 is the respective accession number.

I'm trying to go from accession name to gene name because subsequent analysis is 100x easier.

I'm trying to figure out if Excel can help me with a solution. I used a database to convert the accession names to gene names, but it discarded repeat inquiries (so if I have 7 incidences of A0A024QZP7, it only gave back 1 CDK1 entry (corresponding gene name)).

Here's what I envisioned as a fix:

Column A - Original list of data with their accession name.

Column B - Function to assess a sample in A, check it in column C, then paste in corresponding gene name from Column D.

Column C - New list of accession names, no repeats

Column D - List of corresponding gene names to accession names (in correct order)

Column 1 is the multiple.  
Column 2 is the word to display when a number is a multiple of the value in column 1.  

This table is R rows tall.  

Then assume we have another table listing the integers running from M to N where both are positive integers and N is larger than M.  For each value in this table, it should return the words from column 2 of the lookup table for each value in column 1 that is a multiple of.

So for example, if our lookup table had  

3 = Duck    
5 = Goose   
7 = Pigeon  

Then (selected values only)

3 = Duck    
5 = Goose    
7 = Pigeon    
15 = DuckGoose    
21 = DuckPigeon    
35 =  GoosePigeon     
105 = DuckGoosePigeon

I hope there is some way of making a conditional formatting formula that makes it possible to leave the ""/50"" part in the excel so it is easy to read.

I use it not only to keep track of the all the info I need for my transactions, but also to track how much i make and for goal tracking.  As a salesperson, it is incredibly important to set goals and I use this spreadsheet to track my progress towards achieving those goals.

Currently, to estimate what my total income for the year will be,  I have a function that takes the currently amount of money I've made in the year and divides it by the amount of time it's taken to make that money.  For example, if the date is April 1st and I've made $10,000 so far; that's 1/4 of the way through the year and the spreadsheet estimates that I'll make $40,000 for the year.

Here's the problem: Most of my income is made in the summer.  I definitely don't have a straight line consistent income.  I can make very little money the first few months of the year.  Then, bam, spring hits and I make a lot.  This is where my predictive model veers of course, right after the spring market, I've made probably 80% of what I'm going to make for the year.  But my function thinks, ""Hey, he's kicking butt and there's still half the year left"".  My total income estimate skyrockets and then slowly comes down everyday back to reality as the end of the year approaches.

Below are three years worth of my monthly income.  Is there someway to use this data to make a formula or function that better predicts my total income for the year?

excel,Combining many similar files into a file with a template and all the data sets.,"Hi. First of all excuse my English. I don't always know how to correctly express myself.

At work I'm using excel (Office 365) to make documents for employees to track the quality of the manufacturing process (APQP - PPAP systems if you're familiar).  
This means that I have a separate excel file for every of the couple hundred products we make (and I need to change the format on pretty much all of them).  
In principal every document is the same. It has a fixed head with the product name/number and a table where workers enter their measurements. The tables are repeated depending on how many operations a particular product has. 

What I'm asking is how I could insert the operations for every product into a template which would automatically create as many tables as there are operations and also be able to set an arbitrary number of rows for the tables. Can this be done with macros? VBA? 

I'm currently using a different spreadsheet with the tooling info and a Word file with a template used for printing adressess on letters. This works but working with tables in Word gives me a headache. Another issue I can see is that for many products I need an image or a lot of text in the operation description which will probably screw with the formatting.

This is the form I'm currently using. The top half is the header which is only on the first page and below the product name is the table that gets repeated depending on the number of operations.

2. In the next few months we'll be trying an inventory system with Excel and Scan-IT to office app. Is a live excel file a good option for real time inventory tracking? Currently we have a proprietary solution that only tracks materials when a work order is printed but it can't account for the lost quantity due to operator error or damaged materials.

3. What literature/tutorials do you recommend me to check out if I'm mostly dealing with static data and table design? I don't think I need to learn any complex formulas or querry tools yet. 

Thanks for any and all help"
excel,I cant figure out how to sort rows by multiple points in that row,"I have a list of people and going along the row is their data for 2-5 pitches that they throw. Each pitch has an Axis. I want to sort the players by the axis closest to data input in a specific cell on a different tab.

Is there a way to sort through using each of the 2-5 numbers for the player like if the data input is 1:30 I want to sort by the players with a pitch(axis) closest to that 1:30.

My goal is to have the top player of the list to have an axis closest to the input number on a different cell.

Is this possible? any workarounds?

Thanks!

excel,Forcing INDEX / MATCH to return a blank instead of zero if matches to a blank?,"Minor annoyance that I have been having for years - I use INDEX / MATCH all the time to bounce specific logic against datasets by creating helper tables.  For instance, I have transactions for 1000 SKUs but I only want to review a specific list - I will create a helper table that contains a column with these SKUs (primary key) and a status ""INCLUDE"", then index/match to bring in the status into the main dataset and filter by the result in pivots, etc.

In almost all such cases, I wrap the index/match in an IFERROR to result in a blank if no match is found in MATCH.lookup\_array.  However, if a match is found in MATCH.lookup\_array AND INDEX.array results in a blank (example data: SKU, """" which would be the case for all SKUs that exist on the helper table without a status for whatever reason), the formula will return a zero instead.  I have been very inelegantly solving for this by wrapping the IFERROR ( INDEX / MATCH ) in an IF statement that looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    =IF
       (
        IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")=0
        ,""""
        ,IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")
    )

Clearly, this is a very clunky way to code in Excel as I am repeating the same formula twice, need to update twice, etc.  It works, but not ideal.  Anyone happen to know of a better way?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT - solution as per /u/CFAman:

    =TEXT(
    IFERROR(INDEX('Helper Table'!B:B,MATCH(F2,'Helper Table'!A:A,0)),"""")
    , "";;;@"")"

Three words cell    ;      Something something

I want to have my function range update from the original range of [Cn:Gn] to the new range of [Cn:Jn]. I keep having to edit the range manually after I add columns.

excel,Large + frequently updated dataset - how to update it more efficiently?,"So I'm tasked with maintaining an Excel workbook that has three datasets in it, two of which are about 70000 x 80 and 40000 x 150 respectively (plus about 50 columns in each one which calculate other values from this data).

Twice a week I clear this data out and paste fresh data in. This takes something like half an hour if things go well - more if I paste in the wrong tab by accident. 

Much of this data will remain the same - a comparatively small portion of it actually needs to be updated - but I don't know how to single that portion out in Excel.

I've tried to automate this pasting in Python. This sometimes works, but pasting the dataset seems to be on the edge of what this computer can handle, and a 50% success rate is not good enough to script it.  Is there a faster way to do this (amenable to scripting or not)?

EDIT: I should probably mention I'm also good with R, but know of no way to write into an Excel spreadsheet without overwriting the whole sheet or workbook. That's no good, as a number of formulas are set up in the workbook."

excel,Merging queries causes expanded columns to error.,"I have an issue where, after I merge two queries, a few columns that previously had contents all report error instead. 

Details:

Query pulls in a report (off salesforce), and then appends the exact same report for different years - these all have the exact same columns/data types, but for different years - so it starts at the report for 2018, then appends 2019, then 2020. 

Then, I expand two columns that contain [Record] data - the records contain an amount and currency, and I expand them into two columns, one for the amount, and one for the currency. So, [Record] -&gt; xxxxxx.xx, USD. Since there’s two columns with these record types, I get a total of four columns from expanding these two. 

Then: I merge (left, outer) another query that adds in additional text columns for each line, based on a column in each query - each item in the column selected in the original query matches an item in the column select in the query to be merged.

Here’s where the problem happens: this merge causes all four of the expanded columns (which again, were amount and currency, amount and currency), instead report error. 

What I’ve tried: I’ve tried expanding the two columns after the merge, but merging before expanding causes the [Record] to turn into text, and loses the option to expand because it’s just text that says [Record]. 

No idea why this is happening, since the merge shouldn’t (?) do anything to any of the columns except just add some columns to the right? Help, please!"

For a volunteer events, I have to create schedules for my teams. Pictured is the most recent one that I did manually. Doing this manually is like playing Sudoku, so I’d love to find a way to make this easier. However, I fear there’s way too many complex rules…? Here’s the run down on these:

* Every event usually starts and ends at a different time
* Every event usually has a different number of teams
* Every event usually has a different number of zones (anywhere from 2-6, typically)
* The letters are zones at the event, the numbers on the left are the team numbers
* Sometimes there are different numbers of teams allowed in a zone at a time
   * In this case, we generally wanted at least one team in A and at least two teams each in of the other lettered zones at a time
* Sometimes events have dinner breaks, sometimes they don’t
* Breaks can’t occur within the first hour or the last hour of the event
* The amount of teams who can be on a break at one time depends on how many teams there are
   * In this case, two teams could be on a break at a time, excluding the minutes of overlap for when they’re going/coming back
* Generally, we like teams to not stay in one zone for too long, and we want each team to experience as many zones as possible for fairness
* Sometimes we have a couple flex teams who go where we need them at the time or who roam anywhere except when covering breaks for other teams

Original data is setup almost like a calendar, a 4x6 matrix of blocks, with each block containing 14 cells in a 2x7 format that each can contain data or remain blank. To the left of each row of blocks in the 4x6 is a merged cell containing a date. 

&amp;#x200B;

|A1 Block 1|B1 Block 1|C1 Block 2|D1 Block 2|

I've managed to write VBA to consolidate all of this data into one table with a new row for each 1x2 data pair from the original blocks, but now I'm trying to clean it.

This data is entered by hand, required output is product\_code : # of cases. Following is how the majority of the data is setup:

&amp;#x200B;

|428392|1500 cs||
|:-|:-|:-|
|392342/392393|100 cs + 200 cs||

If it's the second row with 2 pids separated by a /, and 2 case amounts separated by a +, how can I split that into two individual rows in the table?

Similarly with the last case, splitting the Pids into two rows with 600 cs on each.  
This would cover about 95% of the data, the rest could be manually cleaned by hand. Any help would be appreciated!!

excel,Checkboxes to populate worksheet from templates,"Hello, my use case is similar to [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2ykalj/using_a_macro_to_insert_a_sheet_from_a_template/)

I want to have a series of check boxes on a main page, with numbers beside them that correspond to separate template files. 

When you click the check boxes, I want the contents of the separate template file to be added after the first page in the sequence they are checked, think long-form.

Then, when that template is no longer needed, un-checking the box removes the specific page, and its corresponding contents.

The intended purpose is room management, with specific details needing to be added for each room, but the room usage changes frequently, so that's why it's important for that data to be removed when unchecked.

The audience for this is pretty non-technical, which is why I need for it to work in this fashion, instead of just adding new sheets to the workbook. They will need to print it out daily, so if it isn't possible to remove the added pages, then a lot of paper could be potentially wasted.

excel,What is the best VBA practice for sending out large amounts of emails by creating single file spreadsheets from multiple tabs within a single spreadsheet? Any other multi-store corporate analysts out there operating primarily in Excel?,"TL;DR I am trying to find a way in Excel VBA to use a named range of words to search for that exist in a certain spreadsheet's tabs names to export all tabs that contain that word to a single excel file. Example: In cells A1 I have my first search term ""NYC."" Spreadsheet tabs that contain this name exist in the excel file: NYC Sales by Type, NYC Sales by Individual, NYC AR Headhunt Status. I want to take all these tabs that have the word ""NYC"" in them, export to an excel file, and email it out all in one VBA step.


This VBA would result in the production of many files that contain several tabs each. One file for NYC, one file for LAX, etc., each of which has all the tabs that contain the original tab ""search"" term (in the example of the paragraph above, the search term is ""NYC""). 

The next step would be adding a named range of email addresses to send each specific file to in VBA: e.g. all of the NYC sales staff emails are placed into a named range which the VBA then references and opens up Outlook (or whatever the Windows default email app is) and possibly sets the subject of the email.


I've written some VBA and use some Excel Add-Ons like ASAP Utilities to automate the export of the individual location spreadsheets to individual files, but each of these solutions is imperfect and requires time-consuming manual steps each time (VBA code has hardcoded names of spreadsheets, which from time to time for different reasons change (e.g. ERP export of source data uses a slightly different report name)).


The business has a few dozen locations that all receive several reports weekly and monthly, laid out identically each with their own performance data. All of the excel reports are automated processes except for the process of emailing. Ideally, our ERP would do this out of the box but it's ancient and even the newer versions of it don't provide human-readable reports.

Any other analysts out there working for a multi-store business using just Excel? Any tips?"

excel,"Power Query: Manually add entries to table, without them being overwritten with the next refresh","Hi guys, 

sorry for the wall of text, I tried to explain as much as possible about the situation.

I create a monthly export from SAP which contains production related data, lets call it ""export.xlsx"".
I load the data from export.xlsx into a second file (""data.xlsx"") with Power Query and create one conditional column (""Comment needed?"") where I check whether the value in a previous column (""Runtime"") exceeds a certain value. 

Example for ""data.xlsx"", if the runtime value is &gt;10, a ""Yes"" will be added to the last column, else a ""No"" will be added.

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|
|002|Team 1|6|No|
|003|Team 2|5|No|
|004|Team 2|15|Yes|

If the value was exceeded, I need to get feedback from the responsible team in form of a comment.

Now I didn't want to have multiple people access data.xlsx, so I figured I could just create separate files for each team containing their comments (lets call them ""team1.xlsx"" and ""team2.xlsx"") and have ""data.xlsx"" pull the comments via a query.

So ""team1.xlsx"" would also contain a query pulling the data from ""data.xlsx"" relevant to Team 1 and add a conditional column called ""Comment"", where the comments should go.

Example ""team1.xlsx"", if the column ""Comment needed?"" contains a ""Yes"", then the new column ""Comment"" should contain the phrase ""Please insert comment here"":

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Please insert comment here|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|

Now someone from team1 can open ""team1.xlsx"" and put in a comment for order ID 001:

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Runtime 11 hours due to machine malfunction|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|

And I can pull those comments into ""data.xlsx"" via a query, works just fine.
The problem I have now is that this comment gets overwritten with ""Please insert comment here"" as soon as the query in ""team1.xlsx"" gets loaded again.

|Order ID|Team|Runtime|Comment needed?|Comment|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|001|Team 1|11|Yes|Please insert comment here|
|002|Team 1|6|No|-|


Any ideas how I can preserve the comments?

I guess I somehow need to have PQ check if there are comments which don't equal ""-"" or ""Please insert comment here"" and then preserve these. But no idea how.

I thought about adding the ""comment column"" manually to the table in ""team1.xlsx"" but then I run into problems if the sequence of order IDs somehow gets mixed up.

Thanks in advance!"
excel,Summing values from strings more elegantly,"Hi all;
on mobile, will flair soon. Not at work so pic of my current workbook (and process) will be added in like 7 hours.

Anyway, I work at a paint company and am our primary custom color match-er.  For colorant we use “drops” as our base unit, 48 drops = 1 ounce (y), 32y= 1 quart. So I might use the notation of 1qt2y24 for a single color hit. Several hits later I have a color match.  

When it’s all said and done, I add up my hits for total colorant added. Rows 1-4 are batch and related info, column 1 below the info lists the colorants for that color. Columns 3+ are my individual hits. [heres my sample color match](https://imgur.com/a/aGnN1AI)

Currently method is taking an individual colorant, splitting it into the ounces and drops, putting them into a column of each, summing them and getting creative with the MOD and QUOTIENT functions. 

My questions  are 1) can I parse multiple “1qt2y3” with similar but varying structure, ie there may not be qts or drops; “1qt4y” or “3y”. 2) Is there a good way to have a properly formatted calculated cell? Best I can figure would be conconcatinating calculated cells with text.

excel,"Using xlookup, I want to return an array, from two lookup values, one with a wildcard - I also want to handle duplicate lookup values in the return array.","I have a client list I download from online payment terminal in csv format.

The Table Looks Similar to this - over a year there about 500 transactions similar to what you see below.

Now these customers are recurring, so over a year, I'll have John appearing 12 times, and Shawn 5 times for example.

What I want to see as a result is the table below... obviously I'd want to pull the month down to get an entire year of payments for Mr. Cena.

|Name Search|Name|Month|Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cena|John Cena|September|\#N/A|

I need to be able to see each month of payment for John Cena. 

I'm using something like this : =XLOOKUP(B154,B2:B148,XLOOKUP(""\*""&amp;C154,E2:E148,D2:D148,,2)) which is failing pretty hard.

with index match I could do this no problem with similar code like this - however, it has issues with updating data, too much rework required. 

=INDEX('Sheet2'!E3:E59,MATCH($A$10,'Sheet2'!$A$3:$A$69,0))

**PART 2** of the problem, is handling multiple payments in the same month.

Example:

|Customer Name|Amount|Date of Payment|

|John Cena|2500|September 1, 2019|

excel,Does anyone have a solution to add upcoming arrival of POs into an inventory planning workbook based on date?,"I manage inventory at an online retail company with 250+ SKUs and I am looking for a better solution for our inventory forecasting models. 

Currently, I have all the main relevant information on a dashboard-table with one SKU per row, and columns that are pulling data for current stock on hand, open purchase orders from our factory, open sales orders, average weighted sales, and months-worth of inventory based on these numbers. 

I also created a by-month forecasting section that automatically figures out, based on the current date, what the inventory will look like by-month for the next five months. This is done by taking current levels and assuming average monthly sales. 

The forecasting piece is missing a really important piece of information - PO arrivals. I have a table on a separate sheet that has all of our PO detailed information by SKU (ie: SKU, quantity ordered, expected date of arrival). Currently, I'm just doing a vlookup to pull any POs and adding it to my PO columns.

What I would like to figure out is how to reference that PO detail sheet, grab a PO by-SKU, and insert it into my forecast based on the anticipated arrival date. 

ie: If a PO for 1000 items of SKU# CKW-312 is arriving on March 12th, 2019, then I would like that to be added into the forecast model that month. See below.

Any thoughts?

There are 2 macros that I'm not sure how to write it out. For the first one will be a macro that highlights differences between the 2 tables. I don't think conditional formatting works. The second one will be a macro that adds in new data without affecting data that have been changed above. The reason why I am doing this is that I couldn't change any data that is inside the first table. Hence, I will need to create another table that features the changed data. Although, it might be good to just highlight the data manually whenever it changes, but I'm worried that the user that is changing might forget to highlight the changed data.

Here's what I'm wondering if we can do: Can we have Sheet 1 Column B calculate the total hours for each name, by somehow adding the hours in Sheet 2 Column K based on if the name is in the same row in Column I? Does that make sense?

(In other words, each cell in Sheet 1 Column B equals the total number from Sheet 2 Column K for each person.)

excel,File is locked try again later,"Hi.

Recently the following error started to appear a lot more frequently when we save after updating.

""file is locked, try again later""


We fix it by saving it with another name.


Is there a way to fix it? I read it can be caused by having different versions if excel. I know its not the case since everybody has the same software and version.


Also Im not sure if we own office 365. Can we prevent this error by turning it into a co-authoring file?"
excel,Creating a chart to show a person's location,"Hi,

I'm looking to create a chart to show where a certain person will be. The day is split in 3 parts (morning, day, evening) and I would like to have the chart show that for example Steve will be in city xyz in the morning and day of Monday and will then go to another location by Monday evening and will stay there until for example Wednesday morning.

Example of what I was able to create is included. What I am missing in my own creation:

* I would love to have the lines connect instead of having a gap between (a vertical line or something like that to show it's a new day would be great if possible)
* The text at the bottom isn't properly centered (the day at the bottom)
* The vertical axis has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Is there a way to have this show city names? I couldn't get that to work.

I've included an example table below, in which the 4 X's are in place, and the total 'score' of the assessed fighter will equal 8.

excel,Anyone else notice the formula 'upgrade' they introduced to Excel yesterday?,"I'm using Office 365 and randomly about 24 hours ago, Excel popped up with a little notification saying they 'upgraded' the way formulas work and that we'll start seeing '@' symbols start appearing in our formulas.  I should've clicked 'more info' but instead just said 'got it', and now I'm wondering what the purpose is.

Anyone know why this change was made?  Formulas still work and are written the same way but then Excel will insert an @ symbol and it's honestly just a bit annoying since I'm not sure the purpose and can't really find any documentation of it.

I have a data model set up - Calendar table (linked to headcount and spend), Headcount table, Spend table, and country reference table (linked to headcount and spend)

I've set up a pivot table with the date as teh rows, the Headcount measure and Spend measure in the values, and the country in the columns

The pivot chart based off this is a combo chart showing spend and headcount over time, split by country.

Easy peasy right, except when i change the slicer (country), the actual chart type reverts back to a bar from (from the combo chart)

One interesting this is that if i remove Country from the columns on the pivot table, then the chart type maintains formatting when using filters. Something about adding the country to the pivot table itself makes it revert to default formatting

I've looked online and seems to be an issue for a lot of people and there are a lot of weird methods to overcome this. I've tried a couple to no avail. Has anyone encountered this? Has anyone got a best solution to hand? there's so many variations of this same issue it's hard to identify the correct and simplest solution!

excel,How do I create a dynamic link to the first empty cell in a non-numeric column?,"TL;DR: In search of a dynamic hyperlink to the first empty cell in a non-numeric column.

Hiya r/excel, hope you are doing well today.

I have been spending a good part of my trying to create a link in cell A5 that will take me to either the first empty cell in a non-numeric column (H) or the last entry in that column. The column consists of a repetition of five categories (such as admin and literature research) in a fairly random sequence. As its an ever-growing list, the last entry will keep on going down.

I have tried several formulae in Excel2013, but this one came the closest to functioning:

    =HYPERLINK(""[MyBook.xlsx]Sheet1!$H$""&amp;MATCH(CHAR(255);H:H;1)+1;""Last entry"")

With *closest to functioning*, I mean that it worked until I changed the first column identifier `$H$` from a `B` to an `H`. It stopped working, so I changed it back and then it all fell apart seemingly.

I have based my formula on one found on a [website](https://www.get-digital-help.com/quickly-jump-to-last-row-in-a-data-set-using-excel-hyperlink-function/), because I am one of those people fairly proficient in computers because they know how to use a search engine.

excel,Multiple Timeline Slicers Based On Multiple Date Tables?,"Hi r/excel,

First time poster here and I hope you can help (Office 365 Business). I have been trying to analyze a dataset and I have two different date columns I want to filter a chart by in pivot tables (Date Sold, Closed Date). I have a date table in power pivot with a relationship with Date Sold.

However, if I add in both Date Sold and Closed Date to a pivot table, and tie it to a timeline slicer using the date table that has a relationship with Date Sold, the Closed Date data doesn't show correctly. I think it is using the relationship to Date Sold as a filter as it shows the same values as date sold, but the correct values if i use a different pivot table without a timeline slicer, but matching manual date filter. [Pic Here](https://imgur.com/mekucPM)

I assume I cannot get around this, please tell me I am wrong.

As a work around I am trying to use two separate pivot tables, and make a chart using cell references using those two outputs. I created a second date table in power pivot and created a relationship between that and Date Closed. I am looking to make reports using these, so I am adding slicers for ease of use. 

Here is the problem: If I want a second timeline slicer using Date Closed, I cannot create one. Excel shows a loading icon and nothing appears, and there is nothing to undo. I can create date slicers, but that is a lot of manual clicking for what I am looking for, and i don't want repeat months, I need a timeline.

Column B -&gt; First Name 
Column C -&gt; Last Name 


I need to create a search feature where a coworker can simply type either the first or last name in a cell and the data set can automatically be filtered and only showing matching names. 

I know I can do conditional format to highlight the matching cell but to save time for my coworker, they simply want the data table to be filtered and only show matching names. 


For example if they type ""Walker"" 

They would only want the people with the name ""Walker"" to appear. 
They don't want to use control+F or have to scroll through the data to see a highlighted row. 

I know this can be done in R with the DT package , but that coworker does not have R installed on their laptop, and I don't want to go through the trouble of having to host a shiny app to get this to work. 


Is this possible in excel? Should I use Access instead?

Sorry this is rather difficult for me to describe  hence why I'm including an image.

* I work with around 10-20 nutritional products (main focus is on 3 variables; energy, protein and fibre)
* on most days I need to make up regimens from those products and this involves selecting a product to meet energy and then I need to work out total volume over number of hours (from this I get amount in ml/hour).

What I would like to create is document where

* I have a drop down selection of said products
* the drop down pulls the information (energy, protein, fibre)
* I input the amount of calories required and total volume total calories and total protein and fibre is calculated based on the selection from drop down menu.
* I input number of hours and it calculates the rate in ml/hr based on total volume

I suppose I could work with basic formulas here (as per screenshot) but I just want to know who to get the data to be pulled on selection from drop down menu.

I have typed the formulas and what data they pull from where. but like I have said i would like this to be ""automated"" by just drop down selection

PS&gt; the image does not have fibre but the calculation would be the same as per protein....

Is there anything you've found, and best practices to avoid it?","I've come across issues that I discover later on that make me nervous they've caused errors in the past that I was unaware of.

\- I've found Index Match can have issues if you don't remove the ""Sheet1!"" that occurs when you're moving between sheets to select the MATCH(lookup value.

\- Using Auto-Fill (double clicking the green box) to populate visible cells when your data is filtered may not work as intended.  You must you copy and paste to populate only and all filtered cells

\- You must make sure VLOOKUPs/Index Match lookup array have all unique values or you risk returning an incorrect value.

\- When adding a column to the right of a filtered data set, if you don't reapply the filter to include the new column, its data won't be attached to its intended row.

The guy who did it before me made an excel sheet that was full of nested formulas that I was told not to touch, and just plug-in data into another tab which will move all the data across. From there I can make the necessary tweaks to work with the data as long as the original formulas are unchanged. 

I have now been tasked with making a version for the pre-sales team which in theory should work similarly, but all pre-sales people will get a percentage of every sale as long as it's after their start date and in their region.

I've got a basic pilot model working, where it filters by the currency instead of the Account Owner to handle the region stuff, but I can't figure out how to include the close date being after their start date.


The fomula is: 

    =@IF(ROWS($A$36:A38)&lt;=$C$34,INDEX(Table2[Table ID],AGGREGATE(15,3,(Table2[Booking Value Currency]=$C$8)/(Table2[Booking Value Currency]=$C$8)*(ROW(Table2[Booking Value Currency])-ROW(Table2[[#Headers],[Booking Value Currency]])),ROWS($A$36:A37))),"""")

excel,Excel network links - network reference changing on its own,"Hi guys.

So I normally avoid too many links between workbooks, particularly in different network locations, but the company I’m working for at the moment *loves* them. As about 35 workbooks, literally thousands of links in each one. The kind of thing you really want a proper database or a BI suite for, but no one will pay for.

The problem is that these links have a bit of a habit of changing when you open the files.

For reference, the references are basically all:

V:\Site A\Admin\Finance\...

There are also a few links which read in the more traditional network way:

\\SiteDrive\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance\...

(For clarity, SiteDrive is the physical disk in the server at head office, Site1 is the folder which we have mapped as V:)

Either style of link works. The problem is that when you open some of the files, excel kind of hybridises the two reference styles, so I get:

V:\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance

So it’s inserting the folder from the second style into the first. There isn’t a Site1 folder on the V drive, so obviously the formula don’t evaluate.

I’ve never seen it do it before, it doesn’t do it in every workbooks (some it’s fine every time I open them), in the sheets that are affected, it doesn’t do it every time, and when it does, it doesn’t do it to every formula.

As things stand, I’m just doing a find and replace to correct it when I open the file, but I’m handing this process off to someone who had never opened excel 6 months ago and hasn’t got the strongest computer skills in general, so I’d rather not leave him needing to edit network links in basically any file he opens.

Anyone got any ideas about why it might be doing this or if these somewhere I can dig around to stop it happening?"
excel,Custom sort that ignores certain values,"Hello

I am the owner of a spreadsheet, in which i have create a list fra a data set using a simpel ""=data set cell"" and the filtering and sort that list.  
So far i have only needed to sort be 2-3 value in one columnand then sort the rest of the dates in a different column.

My boss loves this list, and now want to add tags in that first column - but the kicker is that these shouldnt be sorted according to this value, but only by the date column. So far i have tried adding them to the bottom of my custom sort list, but this just means that the are still sorted above the others with the same date.

I am hoping for some kind of workaround, where i can tell Excel to ignore these tags and just sort them as if they didnt exist (but they should still be visible)."

excel,Finding a way to automatically detect similar non-overlapping shipment trend,"Hi guys! 

Not exactly looking for a solution, but just thought I should ask in case anyone had encountered something similar.

My current project requires me to identify possible products that may have taken another.

e.g. SKU A might be taken over by SKU B due to a change in packaging size, but the total weight shipped should still follow the same trend as SKU A. so what I need to do is match SKU As to their respective SKU Bs, so that I can use the historical shipments of A to conduct forecasting. 

My current approach is largely to eyeball it. I have my data sorted by SKU code, with the monthly shipment across, like below:

|SKU|Dec 2019|Nov 2019|Oct 2019|Sep 2019|Aug 2019|Jul 2019|Jun 2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|00001-A|2250||1500|||||
|00002-B||||125|250||375|
|00003-C|||||2250|1500||
|00004-D||2250|1500||2250|750|750|

With the example above, I would link SKU A with SKU C, since C stopped shipping around the same time (and before) A starts, as well as at similar loads (1500-2500, B is much more different cause it's only in the hundreds).

With 40 months worth of data, and some blanks here and there, i was thinking  there should be a more efficient and accurate way to link potential SKUs up, or at least highlight them?

Cheers!"

excel,Pulling transactions from sheet based on month and category,"So i have an excel sheet (actually google docs, but the same formulas would mostly apply) where I keep all my transaction history.

I then have a totals tab where i am able to see for each month the total in each category.

The issue i am now facing is this: Sometimes i'll look at a category of spending and it will be super high. Now in order to dig into where i spent the money i have to go back into my source sheet and manually go line by line and look at the categories and see what i spend. This is a bit cumbersome as i have 100's of transactions a month, plus scanning like this doesn't yield the kind of insights i'd like.

What i now want to do is create some kind of summary table where i can select the month or date range i want to check, and specify the category, and have it show me all transactions in the category, or by vendor etc.

How do i do that? As i mentioned, i have all this data in google sheets. if someone know how to do it directly in sheets that would be awesome, otherwise if you tell me the excel solution i can then see if sheets has something similar."

excel,Having trouble summing multiple instances by part of a date,"For work I have to summarize the total number of items sorted per hour for various locations over a 6 month period. The data that I was provided with is all raw and an example of it is as follows:

[Column A                                     Column B                          Column C  ](https://preview.redd.it/0eicas12r7c41.png?width=393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=997bd7c1b30b6b75675c1da54ffeef83e5727926)

&amp;#x200B;

On the left is the date **Column A**, in the middle is the locations **Column B**, which are designated as starting with INTLCM and PFOD, so one location like BRANT will need to sum INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT, and on the right is the items flagged per hour for that location **Column C**. What I need to do is summarize all instances of data for a location on each day, ideally also omitting any numbers below 60.

To clarify, what I'm trying to do is write a formula that will tell me how many items BRANT processed an hour for each day. So I need to sum the total number in **Column C** that corresponds with INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT for a day (EG 2019-05-28), then divide that total by the number of instances of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT appeared on 2019-05-28.

So for example; if the total sum of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT on 2019-05-28 is 5000, and there are 5 instances of INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT on 2019-05-28 in total, I need the formula to spit out ""1000"".

What I've used so far is

=ROUNDUP(IF(COUNTIFS(A2:A215,G3,B2:B215,E9),SUMIF(B2:B215,E9,C2:C215)+SUMIF(B2:B215,E37,C2:C215),"""")/(COUNTIFS(A2:A215,G3,B2:B215,E9)),0)

&amp;#x200B;

G3 is the date, written as 2019-05-28. Most data also includes time, so the dates appear as 2019-05-28 01:00:00, though I can delete the time manually. 

E9 is one part of the text I need to filter by, in this case INTLCM-BRANT

E37 is the other part of the text I need to filter by, in that case PFOD-BRANT

In reality the ranges need to be in A:A, B:B, and C:C form as the data extends down way farther than you could scroll. So far though I can't seem to manage to get it to ONLY filter by date, as when I write the formula was A:A, B:B, and C:C it just counts everything that a specific location like INTLCM-BRANT and PFOD-BRANT did.

excel,How to remove elements that do not fall within a specific range and calculate without them?,"I apologize if I'm bothering anyone here, just a question for a college class.

Essentially we have about 700 data points sorted into something like 145 columns as per the assignment requirement, we were required to find the mean and standard deviation for each of these columns. Easy enough, we all got to that point. We then had to find plus and minus four standard deviations from the mean, and we are supposed to remove the data points that do not fall within this range and recalculate the mean and standard deviation. We were able to find the range values we needed, but eliminating the values not within this range has proved to be a pain. No one can seem to come up with a good way to do this.

I've read on a few resources that you can use the AND function to define a range, but it only returns true or false. I also saw somewhere that COUNTIF could work, but I'm not sure how to plug that into a formula that would ultimately result in finding the average or the standard deviation.

We've all been thrown into this class with little to no Excel experience and this is the very first assignment we've been given. Please talk to us like we're 5. We could really, really use it.  Our professor isn't helping and this is quite possibly our last resort.

I will be as responsive as I can, so if there is any additional information you guys need I will be more than happy to provide it! Thank you so much!!!

excel,How do I print pages with numbers dynamically?,"More specifically, say I need to print 10 sheets that are exactly the same, except for being numbered. 
As in 1 of 10...2 of 10...3 of 10...etc etc

Is there an easy way of doing this where I can type in whatever number I need into a cell on 1 sheet then have it print out to the specified number with that format?

excel,"Comparing 2 sheet columns, returning third value only if matching","Excel 2010.

I'm trying to cut down busy work by allowing excel to compare a column on sheet 1 to one on sheet 2, and filling in a value from sheet 2 onto sheet 1. 

Example:

Sheet 1 has Columns A (Name), B (Sales), C (Credit Card Sales) and D (Credit Card Sales Percentage)

Sheet 2 has Columns A (Name) and B (Credit Card Sales)

Because of the way my company does reports, the sales report and the credit card sales report are two different reports and every day I need to turn it into one.

One difficulty is that there will always be some names that got 0 credit card sales, so their names will not populate on sheet 2.  This means I need a way to compare names, and return a 0 in Sheet 1 column C if there is no name match.  If there is a name match, then the credit card sales need to populate in S1 column C.  The two lists will not have the same number of names.

So sheet 1 could have 8 people, sheet 2 could have 5 people, but there needs to be an entry for each person in S1 column C.

I need to understand not only what to do but how it does it because if I can get this working I can use the same functions for other reports, saving several hours of tedium.

I am ok with excel basics but struggle with more advanced (or, likely to most here, intermediate) functions.

Thanks in advance!"

***AMOUNT*** is a user input.

The formula in the box for ***John Smith*** within ***CA SUI - Amount*** is the following:  
=0.047\*IF(C2 &lt; 7000, C2, IF(C2 &gt; 7000, 7000))

The formula in the box for ***JANE DOE*** within ***NY SUI - Amount*** is the following:

For both I want to set a condition to return a value of 0.00 if the States' taxes does not match the employees' residency. So, for the instance of ***John Smith***, how can I combine the ***CA SUI - Amount*** formula&lt;above&gt; to include a VLOOKUP to check if John does indeed need to pay **CA SUI.** For redundancy's sake, since John does live in CA and not NY, I would need the ***NY SUI - Amount*** formula to return the value 0 after utilizing a VLOOKUP confirming he is indeed not associated with NY.

excel,Formula that will check if categories got added or dropped,"I have a column that consists of 50 rows of category data that comes off of a live feed.

For example, next time the live data is refreshed, I don't want to have to go into the formula and change 50 to ""51"" (if a category is added) every time.

excel,How to evaluate two power queries to find their matches,"I am a power query noob and have a question on making a relationship between two tables.

This is my data model right now

https://imgur.com/gallery/QjxUGqK

I have the query “devices reporting” and the query “MIF Reports.” I also have a Serial number index query which is just the MIF report but only unique values. Both devices reporting and MIF have tons of duplicate serial numbers because they have 2 years of data in there. Some serial numbers are in many months so there will be many duplicates. The MIF has some serial numbers that are on the devices reporting and some that are not. The devices reporting, also has some serial numbers that are on the MIF and some that are not. What I am trying to do, is get a list of serial numbers that are on both reports. Then, I want to know whether the “active?” Column in the devices reporting column is “yes” or “no”. My end goal is to get a pivot table, that has the months as rows, and “yes” “no” as columns and then the counts of how many machines are “yes” or “no” active and on both MIF and devices reporting. 

Hopefully this makes sense. I need to get this set up and done and I can see that it is super close.

Can I shrink them down so they do not extend past the one small cell they are in and then give the user an easy option to open the rest of the text? 

I understand you can hide text by formatting the cell but I don’t want the user to have to go through this everytime they need to open this supplemental information. Can there be some kind of button on the cell that the user clicks and it can open up this hidden paragraph?"
excel,How to automatically update different cells on a separate sheet,"Here’s what I need: I’m trying to do payroll for our tiny business. I have a sheet with all the financial info, gross pay and formulas to calculate deductions, net pay, YTD numbers, and quarterly numbers. I want a second sheet to be an employee’s pay stub and when I enter the gross pay on the first sheet, the second sheet is updated and recalculates all the deductions. All I’ve found on Google so far is how to change the same cell on multiple sheets, but this won’t be the same cell every time. 

Is this doable? What I’ve been doing is just manually updating a pay stub template in Word but it takes time and increases the risk for typos. 

Please explain like I’m a child because I don’t use Excel often beyond the SUM formula."
excel,Incentive program with an exponential increasing graph,"So I would like to create an incentive program, based on booking figures.

Below 80% of target, no bonus will be paid. Payment starts with 10% of the total bonus when 80% of target is reached. At 100% of target, 100% of the bonus wil be paid.

However, I don’t want this line to be lineair from 10% to 100% but exponentially increasing.

How can I create an excel graph, or advise me the right formula to create this curve. I can’t seem to get it right.  


Edit: See the picture, I had some help from a colleague as well. It's a queston for my dad, soon will find out if this is the formula he needs. Can't put all of your answers to the test yet as i'm at work, will do afterwards!

Already massive thanks for thinking with me!
